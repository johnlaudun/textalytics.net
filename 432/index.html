<h1 id="america-in-legend">America in Legend</h1>
<p>English 432: American Folklore<br />
MW 1:00-2:15, HLG 202  </p>
<p>Professor John Laudun<br />
HLG 356, MW 2:30-3:30, Tuesdays 9:00–12:00, and by appointment. 482-5493 or laudun@louisiana.edu</p>
<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>
<p>The course is designed to introduce participants to the basics of folklore studies, both through an initial &ldquo;bootcamp&rdquo; as well as through ongoing readings &ndash; some as a focus for conversation, others as sidebars, and then to explore the way that America is socially constructed through stories we tell, sometimes to cheer ourselves on, and sometimes to scare ourselves silly. As an advanced course for undergraduates and a foundational course for graduate students, this course attempts to address folk materials and dynamics in terms of rhetorical effectiveness, literary/generic structure, and cultural history. Some students will be interested in the theory that will be used, albeit lightly, throughout the course, and non-folklorists interested in American literature and culture will find the historical dimensions critical to understanding certain genres/topics of American fiction.</p>
<p>The goal of this course is to examine online, and offline, legends and understand the sources, both structural and referential, upon which they draw. Social media will be one of our foci, and as such this course highlights that media, first, has always been social, and that, second, the social world has always been mediated. Because of the personal nature of much of social media, participants in this course will need to have an open mind about the nature of meaning, and, just as importantly, about the varieties of human experience and perception. Much of the material in this course reveals the anxieties and fears, the prejudices and blindnesses, that humans too often carry with them and rarely communicate directly, only allowing them to slip out indirectly, in stories and assertions that manifest what are often tangled knots of things thought and/or felt. In some cases, the knots are not pretty.</p>
<h2 id="course-requirements">Course Requirements</h2>
<p>For matters of daily comportment and responsibility, please see <a href="../guides/essentials/">The Essentials</a>.</p>
<h3 id="texts">Texts</h3>
<p>A great deal of the readings are scholarly in nature and will be available either as links to JSTOR and Project Muse or through the course’s Moodle site, either as PDFs or as links to sites. In addition to the on-line materials, there are a few books required for this course. Those titles will be given to you within the first few weeks of classes. Expect to purchase between 2 and 4 books, so be sure to set aside a portion of your budget for that expense, in addition to the cost of printing other materials as needed.</p>
<h3 id="assignments">Assignments</h3>
<p>The assignment schedule for this course is simple: participation, exams, and a course project. Participation is worth 20% of your grade. Each of the exams is worth 15%; and the course project is worth the remaining 50%.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Participation</strong> can be a source of confusion. Does it mean just showing up? Showing up is understood: an advanced course depends upon all of us being in the room (on time) and being prepared to discuss the topic at hand. A 400-level course in the humanities is not a data dump, but an opportunity to absorb new material, digest it, use it to analyze old and new points of information, and create new forms of knowledge that may be interesting or valuable to no one else but yourself. Active engagement with the materials, the topics, and others is requisite to achieve full marks in participation.</li>
<li>The course <strong>project</strong> requires independent enterprise on the part of course participants, who are free to choose from a wide variety of topics, so long as they can make a case to me both in the intial proposal and in the paper itself that it fits within the scope of the course. The wide possible scope is on purpose, but negotiating the parameters of the project with the instructor is <em>required</em>. In order to encourage participants to take full advantage of the course&rsquo;s lengthy drafting process, half of the project’s final grade, or 25% of the overall grade, is based on completion of the drafting process, which in many instances is no more than turning in the required items on time. Full credit, full stop. (Looking for a project? There&rsquo;s always <a href="https://www.snopes.com/50-hottest-urban-legends/">50 Hottest Urban Legends on Snopes</a>.) Please note that this is an advanced undergraduate, foundational graduate course in the humanities: our focus is on texts. Please make sure that any work you turn in for evaluation is similarly focused.</li>
<li>The <strong>exams</strong> are what they are, though they are sometimes replaced with take-home writing assignments to be completed by a specified deadline.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p>A lot of collections of &ldquo;American folklore&rdquo; have been published over the years, each with its own assumptions about both &ldquo;America&rdquo; and &ldquo;folklore&rdquo; as well as what the purpose of such a collection should be. Typical of one kind of collection are those by Charles Skinner, whose <em>Myths and Legends of Our Own Land</em> reaches 9 volumes. A more synthetic, and more contemporary, reference can be found in the <em>American Folklore: An Encyclopedia</em>, edited by Jan Brunvand, a copy of which is available in the university library (Reference GR101.A54). While dated by contemporary scholarly perspectives, the collection of essays in Don Yoder’s <em>American Folklife</em> (GR105.A6) is still quite useful, and foundational in many ways.</p>
<p>In addition to reference works focused on the topic of American folklore, there are a myriad of other specialist reference works, many of which are available either in electronic formats or in the library for your use. Consider the following titles: <em>The Greenwood Encyclopedia of African American Folklore</em>, <em>Encyclopedia of Asian American Folklore and Folklife</em>, the <em>Encyclopedia of Life Writing</em>, <em>The Greenwood Encyclopedia of World Folklore and Folklife</em> are all the kinds of entry texts, being encyclopedias that will be familiar to your freshman/sophomore self but will also get your junior/senior/graduate self on the road to more serious and substantial work. That is, in addition to a synthesis/summary of a topic from a particular perspective, most scholarly encyclopedias also offer a small number of suggested readings. Please follow through on those readings the way you would a link on a web page.</p>
<h2 id="institutional-necessities">Institutional Necessities</h2>
<p>One day, the University will create a central resource that collects stuff like this, but until then, they ask faculty to include things like this:</p>
<h3 id="emergency-evacuation-procedures">Emergency Evacuation Procedures</h3>
<p>A map of this floor is posted near the elevator marking the evacuation route and &ldquo;Designated Rescue Area.&rdquo; Students who need assistance should identify themselves to the instructor.</p>
<h3 id="accessibility-services-disability-services-other-helpful-people">Accessibility Services, Disability Services, &amp; Other Helpful People</h3>
<p>The university maintains a wide variety of services and centers designed to help students who have either ongoing or emergent needs. Please don’t hesitate to contact any of these folks, <a href="http://louisiana.edu/academics/academic-support-services">http://louisiana.edu/academics/academic-support-services</a>, and don’t be embarrassed to talk to me.</p>
<h2 id="course-agenda">Course Agenda</h2>
<p>Please note two things: First, that this course does not follow a fixed, calendrical schedule, but, rather, an agenda. If you miss class, reach out to one of your contacts to ascertain where we are in the agenda. Second, in most cases, the direct link to an article or other kind of resource is posted in this course. In a number of instances, the direct link is to JSTOR, since that is where a number of folklore studies journals are archived. Please see the note on <a href="../guides/access/">accessing materials</a> for more information on successfully accessing databases and data repositories.</p>

<h3 id="matters-of-fact">Matters of &ldquo;Fact&rdquo;</h3>
<p>As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_the_Universe_Changed">Wikipedia</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Day the Universe Changed</em> is a British documentary television series written and presented by science historian James Burke, originally broadcast on BBC1 in [Spring] 1985 by the BBC [and rebroadcast on PBS in Autumn 1986]. The series&rsquo; primary focus is on the effect of advances in science and technology on western society in its philosophical aspects. The title comes from the philosophical idea that the universe essentially only exists as one perceives it through what one knows; therefore, if one changes one&rsquo;s perception of the universe with new knowledge, one has essentially changed the universe itself. To illustrate this concept, James Burke tells the various stories of important scientific discoveries and technological advances and how they fundamentally altered how western civilization perceives the world. The series runs in roughly chronological order, from around the beginning of the Middle Ages to the present.</p>

<h3 id="legends-as-performances">Legends as Performances</h3>
<p>In addition to thinking about folklore <em>qua</em> texts, folklorists have also developed a robust model of folklore as transactional in nature: folklore was &ldquo;equipment for living&rdquo; (Kenneth Burke) or folklore as a way to get social business done. Some describe this as a contextual approach, but the term most often associated with it is performance. The articles below focus on the nature of contexts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Facebook is an enormously powerful corporation, harnessing both the self-disclosed and gleaned personal data of over 2 billion people. Its user-base is larger than the population of any country. The company is all pervasive online, tracking and profiling users and non-users alike. Cracking the Code looks at the insides of this giant machine and how Facebook turns your thoughts and behaviours into profits—whether you like it or not. And it’s not just a one-way transaction either. Cracking the Code also explains how Facebook uses vast troves of web data to manipulate the way you think and feel, as well as act—all in the sole interests of Facebook, masquerading as “community.” What are the social implications of this—when one company basically controls the insights and experiences of the entire online world, with extremely personalised and targeted social and behavioural engineering on a scale never before seen?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are experiencing a fundamental paradigm shift in our relationship to knowledge. From the ‘information age’, we are moving towards the ‘reputation age’, in which information will have value only if it is already filtered, evaluated and commented upon by others. Seen in this light, reputation has become a central pillar of collective intelligence today. It is the gatekeeper to knowledge, and the keys to the gate are held by others. The way in which the authority of knowledge is now constructed makes us reliant on what are the inevitably biased judgments of other people, most of whom we do not know.</p>

### Joking and Socializing

To go along with our reading of Zora Neale Hurston's _Mules and Men_:

* Hurston singing ["Uncle Bud"](http://biblioklept.org/2009/02/27/zora-neale-hurston-sings-uncle-bud/). And here's Boozoo Chavis singing ["Uncle Bud"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEgbfXdzb28), keeping the ribald nature of the song alive and well. (Feel free to click on the links for live versions of the song, including one by, I think, a Japanese zydeco band.)
* And a collection of Hurston singing [a variety of folk songs](https://www.floridamemory.com/audio/hurston.php).
* When Zora sings in Polk County she sings ["John Henry"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_(folklore))(link is to Wikipedia article for those who don't know the story/history of the song.) If you want to see what railroad looked like throughout much of the twentieth century, especially in the South, have a look at ["Gandy Dancers'](https://youtu.be/3r_cI3kYYhM), a 1973 film documentary.
* If you don't know what a work song sounds like, then this version of ["Rosie"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmMyPVLqyzE), recorded by the Lomaxes at Mississippi State Prison in Parchman is as good a place as any to start understanding a much broader folk song tradition than we will have time to address in this course.
* There is also this upload of Bill Ferris' ["I Ain't Lying"](https://youtu.be/Smwr24UCRXo). Watch the first five minutes at least.


### Impersonations

If you consider the root of impersonation, you are confronted with the idea of being in another person for the sake, quite often, of humor. But, as the Apache point out, no matter what your intent, there are always multiple possibilities whenever you dwell elsewhere. (In some way, the argument for reading is that by being (in) others while reading, we are allowing ourselves to imagine, simultaneously, what it is like to be someone else *and* what it is like not to be ourselves. Both of those are very powerful questions -- and that is why, perhaps, we usually contain impersonations within a humorous frame.

For the next class, please read the following four pieces, three of which are really quite short. Only the Dundes is an essay-long consideration of ethnic humor. The short note that follows the Dundes below, considers how the light bulb joke begins in ethnic humor but visits other topics.

Please read in the order listed:

Welsch, Roger. 1967. American Numskull Tales: The Polack Joke. _Western Folklore_ 26/3: 183-186. [JSTOR](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1498447).

Wukasch, Charles. 1969. American Numskull Tales: The Aggie Joke. _Western Folklore_ 28/3: 214-215. [JSTOR](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1499269).

Dundes, Alan. 1971. A Study of Ethnic Slurs: The Jew and the Polack in the United States. _Journal of American Folklore_ 84/332: 186-203. [JSTOR](http://www.jstor.org/stable/538989).

Kerman , Judith. 1980. The Light-Bulb Jokes: Americans Look at Social Action Processes. _Journal of American Folklore_ 93/370: 454-458.[JSTOR](http://www.jstor.org/stable/539876).

Accents, in speech, can be considered one facet of stereotypes. Here are some [Irish people doing North American accents](https://youtu.be/JVjL0i74Drw).



*I think we are going to skip this next session on treasure legends and go to contemporary legends, what are often called "urban legends" or "urban myths."*

### Treasure Tales

This essay from Hurley represents folklore scholarship from the late forties. Be aware that there is some outdated language here. The essay itself is only 8 pages long. The rest of the entry is 102 summaries of treasure tales.

Hurley, Gerard T. 1951. Buried Treasure Tales in America. _Western Folklore_ 10/3: 197-216. [JSTOR](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1496333).

Mullen introduces us to the notion of a "folk idea", something we will explore in the weeks ahead.

Mullen, Patrick B. 1978. The Folk Idea of Unlimited Good in American Buried Treasure Legends. _Journal of the Folklore Institute_ 15/3: 209-220. [JSTOR](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3813976).

This is the one time that I will, as a professor, make you read my own writing. I am doing so both because our topic is treasure legends and the paper offered here is on Louisiana treasure legends but also because as something written early in the stages of a research project it has plenty of flaws and gaps.
