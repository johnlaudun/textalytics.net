            <p>Ph.D. Comprehensive Examination
Area 12: Folklore
Fall 2012</p>
<p>Note: Indicate on the exam (and on the envelope containing the exam) whether you are taking this exam as a major or minor. Major exams should show evidence of extensive, in-depth knowledge of the field. You will be allowed five (5) hours to complte the exam. Allow 4 hours total for writing the three essays, leaving the remaining hour to plan, review, revise, and proofread.</p>
<p>Directions: In response to three of the questions or propositions below (select one from each of the three groups below), write well-developed essays that articulate and develop a thesis or argument. If the question asks for an explanation or description, be sure to present a focused, well-developed response.</p>
<p>Group One: Disciplinary and Theoretical Concerns</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Like a number of disciplines within the academy, it is not uncommon to find in folklore studies that a few key terms are central to any particular moment in its discourse (e.g. “performance”). Choose from among any of the terms that you believe to have possessed such centrality or to possess it currently and argue for why it has, or had, that status. Alternatively, choose a term either from folklore studies’ past or from another discipline and argue why that term should become central (again).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a considerable portion of its history, folklore studies was transfixed by the folktale. In what way did that focus shape the discipline? What insights did it lead to and what blindnesses has it bequeathed us?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Group Two: Texts and Contexts</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In a recent work on folklore and fiction, Frank DeCaro and Rosan Jordan situate the distinction between folklore and literature as: “written language vs. oral (and even non-verbal) . .  fixed, printed text vs. a shifting, unwritten one; a physical text vs. memory.” The central premise of DeCaro and Jordan’s claim, that there exists a fundamental tension between orality and literacy, has a long history in our discipline (e.g.       )   In this essay, look at three works of literature that interrogate and even trouble this binary in form and/or in content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Folklore studies presents the opportunity to uncover overlooked dimensions of literary texts (for example,  folk belief, foodways, and folk costuming). For this answer, perform a close reading of several literary texts that focuses on one such dimension.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Group Three: Arenas for Application</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You’ve been invited to lecture at another university on the topic of  Folk Heroes. What would you discuss and why?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establish parameters for a lesson plan or outreach program to be used in a local community that integrates living history or folk culture.  In your essay, be sure to elucidate your perspective, your rationale, and your interpretive framework. If you have time, feel free to include details or specific examples.</p>
</li>
