# FOLKLORE READING LISTS

The following lists are meant only to describe a certain minimum of books of which  candidates for degrees with folklore concentrations should have some familiarity. The lists are minimal in two dimensions: (1) they circumscribe a core of texts which act as a kind of core for folklore studies to which (2) every folklorist adds their own cache of books which address his or her own concerns and interests. The combination of these public lists with your private list is the starting point for any project. The lists below are cumulative. Thus those texts required at the M.A. level are expected at the Ph.D. level of study.

In addition to the four lists of required and recommended texts for the M.A. and Ph.D., we have included a basic library of books on Louisiana folklore and folklife, specialized reference works with which all folklorists should be familiar, and a reader available for checkout and photocopying which contains core articles otherwise unavailable or difficult to find.
