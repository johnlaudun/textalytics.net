# How I Teach

A [number of studies][] have pretty well established that while students, and many teachers, prefer the lecture model, wherein a professor professes and students study, students actually learn better when engaged in active learning. Despite the pretty incontrovertible proof of such studies, most teachers and students dislike active learning.

For students, active learning requires being active in a context that they too often think of as a passive space.
