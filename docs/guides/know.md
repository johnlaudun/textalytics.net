* If you don't know about [Open Culture][], then you should take a look. A variety of materials -- audio books, textbooks -- are available there. In particular, I regularly use their [archive of films][] for teaching.
* Kenneth Burke's "Literature as Equipment for Living" is too useful not to be available more broadly: [URL](./texts/Burke_1941.pdf).
* The ["The Zipf Mystery"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCn8zs912OE).
* [A Short History and Explanation of GREP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTfOnGZUZDk).
* [MICHEL FOUCAULT: An In-depth Explanation in Clear Language](https://www.ataraxik.com/2018/07/14/michel-foucault-explanation/) is a brief and easy to understand explanation of the thought of French thinker Michel Foucault, one of the most cited figures in the social sciences.
