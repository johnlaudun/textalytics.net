# Says / Does

There are a variety of ways to take texts apart, to analyze them, in order to understand how the parts fit together. A good summary must represent all the parts of a text. In a non-fiction text, like a work of scholarship or science, you want to look closely at each paragraph to understand how the author is building his/her argument.

Think of each paragraph as a stepping stone through a large field: there are possibly a number of ways to get from where you start to where you end, but the author has chosen this particular path. The path is nothing more than each step the text takes and a paragraph, for the time being is a step.

*Nota bene*: We can do the same for sentences within a paragraph, but that kind of "zoomed-in" analysis we will do elsewhere. For now, we will stay at a slightly higher level, "zoomed out" if you will -- this scaling, zooming in and out, of analysis is very useful for compartmentalizing the work we do in analysis.

The easiest way to do a *says/does* analysis is to make the process simple and clear:

1. Draw a vertical line down the middle of a piece of paper -- or make a table in a word processing document -- creating two columns. On the left is the *says* column; on the right, *does*.
2. Write a phrase of sentence in the left column to summarize the key point of the paragraph. On the right, describe what the paragraph does for the reader: introduce a new point, expand the point of the previous paragraph, describe a particular moment, provide some historical background. The *does* descriptor cannot mention any content in the paragraph.

Usually when I do this in a course, I will divide people into groups and have each group work with a chunk of paragraphs. We then assemble a summary, using the lefthand entries as the content and the righthand entries as means to weigh their importance.

More importantly, writers can use this method of analyzing texts to assess their own: be clear on what each paragraph is doing, because if the writer isn't clear, the reader certainly won't be.

## Examples

| Â¶ | SAYS | DOES |
|---|------|------|
| 1 | That the writer is going to the laundry room and will be there for a while. | Sets the scene both physically or emotionally. |
| 2 | that the writer puts clothes in the washing machine and thinks about her boyfriend   | prepares the reader for alternate description of activities and reflection |
| 3 | that the writer would like to be swept offer her feet by someone rich and handsome | makes a bit of fun of the writer's reflections; shows that she doesn't take herself too seriously |
| 4 | the writer continues with doing what she has to do to get the laundry done but is interrupted (and embarrassed) by someone she doesn't like and by someone who gives her a chalce to reflect amusingly on male behavior  | describes the actual world the writer is in and shows how she reacts to it |
