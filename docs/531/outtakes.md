Nothing is here.

Two of the tales are available entirely in plain text for your use: [Grimms 91](http://johnlaudun.org/texts/grimms_91.txt), sometimes titled as "The Gnome" and sometimes as "The Elves" and ["Jack and the Fire Dragon"](http://johnlaudun.org/texts/hicks_2.txt) as told by Ray Hicks. Formatted versions are: [Grimms 91](../texts/grimms_91.md) and [Hicks 2](../texts/hicks_2.md).
