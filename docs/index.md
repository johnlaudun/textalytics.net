![Bug and Path](img/bug_and_path.png)

This separate, dedicated teaching site is designed so that students can access the materials they need no matter where they are. While I try to make as much as possible available publicly, both for students in my courses as well as to interested others, some course materials must remain behind the university paywall (aka [Moodle][]) due to copyright restrictions. (I take fair use seriously.) If you are a visiting student or scholar and would like access to those materials, please get in touch with [me][].

## Course Sketches

The courses listed below are ones I imagine teaching in a context where both close and distant reading, where both computation and cogitation, feature equally in the treatment of texts.

* [Introduction to Text Analytics](c200-textanayltics.md)
* [The Spread of (Mis)Information](c400-infospread.md)
* [What We Think When We Think about Machine Thinking](c300-ai.md)

While I have never taught these courses as they are sketched out here, they are based on units or features of courses or workshops I have conducted.

## Guides and Statements

There are some things all students in my courses need, or want, to know:

* Here's my list of [interview tips](guides/interview_tips.md).
* If you are not quite sure what a [literature review](guides/lit_review.md) is and you are in a course that requires one, here's a [basic guide](guides/lit_review.md).
* Revising and [editing](guides/editing.md) go hand-in-hand.
* You may use any citation system, preferably the one used by your major, so long as you do so consistently and competently. In the absence of any other system, please feel free to use the one employed by social scientists and humanists around the world known as the [Chicago Author-Date System](guides/cad.md). (It's easier, and makes more sense, than MLA.)
* Navigating the library proxy when connecting to online databases when you are off campus, and understanding the relationship between the library's website and something like JSTOR can be confusing. [Here's some help](guides/access.md).
* [A (Kind of) Handbook on Writing](guides/writing.md) includes sections on how to think of sentences and paragraphs as building blocks, on introductory paragraphs, on how to write summaries, and how to write thesis statements. If you need help with writing, and almost all of us do, then seek it out. Find me, find the Writing Lab, find an experienced writer -- FTR, lawyers write a lot -- or search the web in general or Medium or Youtube in particular.
* There is a common set of guidelines/requirements on how to be a participant in a course I facilitate. Read [The Essentials](guides/essentials.md).
* For my writing-intensive courses, which is almost all of them, I prefer to use Google Drive. Please make sure you have an account and you know not only how to create and edit documents, but you are also familiar with the reviewing functionality, which Google calls *Suggesting*. Google for Education has produced a video on how to research and write a paper using Google Docs, which also has useful tips on how to take and organize notes: [Research and Writing](https://applieddigitalskills.withgoogle.com/c/college-and-continuing-education/en/research-and-writing/overview.html).
* If you don't know about [Open Culture][], then you should take a look. A variety of materials -- audio books, textbooks -- are available there. In particular, I regularly use their [archive of films][] for teaching.

## Nota Bene

In addition to a static [portfolio][], I have also kept a [weblog][] since 2004 or so. Any number of papers, drafts of grant proposals, process notes, tutorials, links, and ideas can be found there. I should note that not everything is on this website yet: migrations are slow processes, if only to simplify maintenance of materials. Fellow faculty should feel free to adapt / adopt any of the materials included here.
