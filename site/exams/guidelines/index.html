<h2 id="areas">Areas</h2>
<h3 id="aas-africana-studies">AAS: Africana Studies</h3>
<p>Primary: portfolio described below.<br />
Secondary:   </p>
<p>Candidates electing to take their major exam in Africana Studies will submit a portfolio that includes the following components: an intergenre bibliography of primary sources (75 texts), a bibliography of secondary sources (25 texts),an annotated bibliography (15 texts), a literature review (10 texts, 4000 words), two questions and answers (4000-4500 words), an oral defense. </p>
<p>The intergenre bibliography of primary sources will demonstrate a sense of breadth and scope of the Africana literary canon, from its beginnings to present. This bibliography can focus exclusively on the African American canon, or the canon can include Anglophone literature from other locations in the Diaspora. </p>
<p>The bibliography of secondary sources will target a topic of the candidate’s choosing, comprised of theory, literary and/or cultural criticism, and literary and/or cultural histories. This bibliography may include texts in translation.</p>
<p>The annotated bibliography will draw fifteen (15) texts from the bibliography of secondary sources. Annotation entry length: 150-250 words. </p>
<p>The literature review will draw ten (10) texts from the annotated bibliography in order to synthesize patterns and convergences that shed light on the scholarly discourse about the candidate’s chosen topic. Review length: 4000-4500 words. </p>
<p>The questions will be devised by the candidate to address concerns significant to the field and to the candidate’s own research. One question should aim to address breadth and scope, demonstrating a broad knowledge of the field, while the other should demonstrate a deep interest in a more specific topic. The student can, and should, work with the faculty members in the construction of these questions, with the understanding that the ability to pose relevant, substantive research questions is one of the skills the portfolio is testing. Each question should be answered in a 4000-4500 word essay. </p>
<p>For this process, the candidate will work with a 3-person faculty committee assigned by the PhD Exam Committee. The candidate is encouraged to meet with the members of the committee individually or as a group several times during the process — to develop and discuss the texts for the annotated bibliography, to consider the writing strategies particular to literature review, to discuss the scope of the questions, and the approach, organization, drafting, and revision of the answers. </p>
<p>(S)he will submit the entire portfolio at a date predetermined with his/her committee, keeping in mind the graduate program’s Ph.D. exam schedule that semester. </p>

<p>Primary Exam Format: Portfolio  + Oral</p>
<p>Candidates electing to take their major exam in American Literature 1945 to the present will submit a portfolio that includes the following components.</p>
<p>A reading list of approximately 50-80 primary sources and 20-30 secondary sources.  The primary source list should include texts equally distributed throughout the period and include texts from multiple genres, including novels, short fiction, poetry, and nonfiction. The secondary source list should survey the field today, meaning that entries represent either a foundational perspective in the field or a significant, recent intervention. The combined reading list must be approved by members of the exam committee.</p>
<p>Two essays that address significant concerns in the field. Early in the process the candidate should work with the exam committee in the construction of these questions. The answers should engage with multiple genres and demonstrate an understanding of historical scope. Early in the process the candidate should work with the exam committee in the construction of these questions. Each essay should be 3,500-4,000 words. </p>
<p>A 2,500 to 3,500-word review essay of three recent critical monographs on American literature from 1945 to the present chosen by the candidate. The candidate should work with the exam committee to select relevant texts to think with and through looking toward the prospectus.</p>
<p>An oral examination focused on the above three components meant 1) to prepare the candidate to write the prospectus and 2) to allow the candidate to expand on the breadth and depth of their understanding of the period as demonstrated in the written portion of their portfolio.</p>
<h3 id="bl1-english-literature-to-c1500">BL1: English Literature to c.1500</h3>
<p>Major Exam Format: Timed on-site</p>
<p>Area 1 for major examinations will be a timed, on-site examination of two separate sittings. Students will take the current three-part exam with any examinees minoring in Area 1. In addition, Area 1 major examines will have an on-site, timed translation test in either Old or Middle English (student&rsquo;s pre-determined choice) – to be taken during the same semester as the other Area 1, before the end of the examination period. The translation portion will call upon students to translate approximately 10-20 lines in one hour.</p>
<h3 id="bl2-english-literature-of-the-renaissance">BL2: English Literature of the Renaissance</h3>
<p>Major Exam Format: Combination—portfolio and oral</p>
<p>Annotated Bibliography of 10 secondary sources relevant to Renaissance studies with annotations of approximately 250-300 words each. </p>
<p>One 25-page paper suitable for submission to a journal or a 15-page creative piece with a 10-page critical introduction.</p>
<p>Once the final version of the portfolio has been submitted, the student will take a 75-minute oral exam based on a Renaissance literature reading list available here. The goal of this oral exam will be for the candidate to demonstrate broad reading knowledge of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century texts. This oral exam will be given by the three members of the student’s major exam committee and does not replace the comprehensive oral exam given after the student has passed the major and three minor exams.  </p>
<p>The portfolio and oral components of the Area 2 Major Exam will be graded as a whole, and the student will receive the results by the announcement date for all other exams given that semester. </p>
<p>If the portfolio and/or oral exam results are unsuccessful, a student may retake one or both components that semester. </p>
<h3 id="bl3-english-literature-of-the-restoration-and-eighteenth-century">BL3: English Literature of the Restoration and Eighteenth Century</h3>
<p>Major Exam Format: Timed on-site (five hours)</p>
<p>The candidate selecting a Major Exam in Area 3 will answer 15 of 20 identifications, 3 of 5 short essay questions, and 1 of 3 long essay questions.</p>
<h3 id="bl4-british-literature-of-the-nineteenth-century">BL4: British Literature of the Nineteenth Century</h3>
<p>Major Exam Format: Combination – portfolio and oral</p>
<p>It is understood that the student will work with the 2 primary readers as the portfolio takes shape ~ i.e. drafts of the portfolio components will be read and commented on by those 2 readers prior to submission of the final version which will contain the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>8-10 page thoroughly researched conference paper. This can be based on a seminar paper, but should be more thoroughly researched and should include a cover letter that includes a conference proposal and the title of a conference to which the paper can be proposed. </li>
<li>20-25 page thoroughly researched article [on a different topic and texts from the conference paper]. This can and probably should be a seminar paper that has been reworked. However, it must have developed quite substantially beyond what was presented in the seminar. This article should be finished enough to be close to submission to a journal, and should include a cover letter [to the examiners] that states the argument and purpose of the article, along with the title of a journal to which it can be submitted. </li>
<li>2-3 page course proposal for a 200-level course for non-majors following our in-house 200-level course proposal guidelines. It should include several genres, should include texts from across the breadth of the 19th century and should not overlap in any significant way with existing courses &ndash; that is, it should be an original course proposal. </li>
</ul>
<p>Once the final version of the portfolio has been submitted, the student will undergo a 1-hour oral exam based on a wide-ranging 19th-cenury British literature reading list [provided to the student by faculty in the area.] This oral does not replace the final exam oral that covers all exam areas. Some reference may be made to weaknesses/strengths in the portfolio during this exam, but the goal of the oral is for the student to display her knowledge of a range of texts from across the long 19th Century. </p>
<p>Examiners will make grading decisions after both the portfolio and oral components are completed. This means that the student must complete both components and will be informed of the pass/fail/needs revision status of the exam as a whole, and receive written comments on the exam as a whole.  The student will receive the result of the whole exam at the exam result announcement date for all exams that semester.</p>
<p>Note: If the student does well in the oral but it is deemed that the portfolio needs additional work, then that revision can be accomplished during the same semester as the exam. If the student does well on the portfolio, but does not do well on the oral portion, then that oral may be retaken that same semester. </p>

<h3 id="cws-creative-writing-studies">CWS: Creative Writing Studies</h3>
<p>Primary Exam Format: Portfolio as described below.<br />
Secondary Exam Format: .  </p>
<p>Candidates electing to take their major exam in Creative Writing will submit a portfolio in their chosen genre that includes the following components: a reading list of 50 texts, an annotated bibliography of 25 texts, a long critical and scholarly essay (18-25 pages), and a short essay (8-10 pages) described below. Essays need to be worthy of &ldquo;B&rdquo; grade or higher in a seminar in order to pass the exam. Please note that the Creative Writing portfolio does not include creative work, and essays should not address one’s own creative work.</p>
<ul>
<li>A reading list of 50 texts compiled by student and approved by CW studies exam committee in their genre, at least one semester before, ideally two semesters before, the exam is due.  Texts may be individual essays, stories, poems, or full-length collections/novels. This list should reflect students critical and creative interests and should be viewed as preparation for the dissertation. The list should be accompanied by 1-2 page explanation of student&rsquo;s topic/interest, including the questions and explorations they hope to engage with. Students should be wary of issues of overlap with other exam areas, and have a range of historical periods on their reading list and secondary as well as primary texts.</li>
<li>Each entry in the annotated bibliography of 25 texts should be 200-300 words, no longer.  Entries should give a general overview of text, should cite at least one specific detail/scene/quoted material from the text, and should explain why text is useful for an investigation into exam topic. Examples of entries are on Moodle. The student is encouraged to submit a draft of one entry to their exam committee for review.</li>
<li>The long critical and scholarly essay (18-25 pages) is not on pedagogy or craft, but on any other topic specified within the declared genre and topic of the exam list, and making an original argument using texts from the list. Must not be a paper previously submitted for a seminar or other course, though may be related in topic to coursework. While the committee will not read full drafts of essays, the student is encouraged to submit their topic/thesis statement to their exam committee for review. </li>
<li>The short essay should examine trends/forms/craft/pedagogy or some aspect of the practice or teaching of creative writing. Pedagogical papers may take on a range of issues in the creative writing classroom, and should be thought of as a paper you could submit to a pedagogical journal. Craft essays should be prescriptive of one element of craft, but also use texts from the student&rsquo;s list to illustrate examples of success in that particular craft element. The student is encouraged to submit their essay topic/thesis statement to their exam committee for review. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fcs-folklore-studies">FCS: Folklore Studies</h3>
<p>Major Exam Format: Portfolio + Oral</p>
<p>The purpose of this exam is to establish your broad familiarity with the scope and sweep of folklore studies from its roots in the Enlightenment to the present moment as well to establish your engagement in a particular topic or thread within that history. To do this, the faculty ask that you: </p>
<ul>
<li>Write a <strong>comprehensive essay</strong> of approximately 5000 words. The essay should be clear to articulate a larger understanding of the domain of folklore studies as well as the writer’s place within it. Paths through periods are perfectly acceptable, with a focus on predecessors encouraged. </li>
<li>Compile a <strong>bibliography</strong> of no less than 50 items, divided into sections of your own devising with each section possessing a head note of 250 words or more. The bibliography should be wider in scope, and perhaps deeper in places, than those sources cited in the essay and could very well include work not yet read or not yet fully digested. </li>
<li>Enumerate a series of <strong>research questions</strong> that identify both future research opportunities and gaps in the domain that you argue should be addressed, either by yourself or others. (Depending upon the complexity of the questions, these could be as few as half a dozen or as many as a dozen.)</li>
<li>Defend the composition and relationships of these components during an oral exam which is meant to showcase the breadth and depth of your understanding of the field.</li>

<li>The <strong>literature review</strong> will draw on the annotated bibliography in order to synthesize patterns and convergences that shed light on the scholarly discourse about the candidate’s chosen topic. Review length: 8-10 pages. </li>
<li>The <strong>journal article</strong> will take as its foundation these two components. The journal article should be approximately 7500 words in length (including notes). While the topic is open, the candidate is urged to consult with faculty to develop the article’s research question. The candidate will research potential journals to which (s)he might submit this article.</li>
<li>For the <strong>pedagogic component</strong> the candidate will submit a document that testifies to his/her thinking about feminism and teaching. A syllabus, statement of feminist pedagogy, narrative of teaching experience with feminism, documentation of class activity or assignment are all potential options. </li>
</ul>
<p>For this process, the candidate will work with a 3-person faculty committee assigned by the PhD Exam Committee. The candidate is encouraged to meet with the members of the committee singly or as a group several times during the process — to develop and discuss the texts for the annotated bibliography, to consider the writing strategies particular to literature reviews, to discuss the scope, research question, approach, organization, drafting, and revision of the journal article.</p>
