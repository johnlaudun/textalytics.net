Course Description My goals for this course are simple: first, to de-mystify reading as a process into a series of discreet activities so that students can understand how texts work: through content, through structure, and through intertextuality; second to have students practice various forms of writing, focusing especially on those forms that help you practice analysis and argumentation. Such writing assignments include, but are not limited to, summaries, outlines, analytical responses, and, of course, the synthetic essay. Course Materials Depending upon the semester, there will be books listed below, but the first thing you need to do is to log onto the course\u2019s Moodle site. (Please come to class before purchasing any books for this class. Sometimes plan change between the time the syllabus is constructed and the time at which a final plan is developed.) Over the years I have developed a number of custom versions of common texts in order to make it easier for you not only to engage in various kinds of reading practices and analyses but also to make sure there are common page numbers to enable better discussions. You will be responsible for printing these materials and having them in class, marked up, and ready to discuss. Reading from devices is prohibited and only reveals you have not read the syllabus clearly. The books you need to buy are: Dick, Philip K. 1970. A Maze of Death . Vintage. (We are going to use the 2013 reprint.) Order the books from your favorite bookseller, the university bookstore or Amazon. There are also a number of texts which are not scribal in nature. That is, this course also takes advantage of various video and audio presentations. Many of these are available in forms that require only a computer and internet connection of modest means: that is, you must have access to a computer that can accept video and audio streams. Some of the materials are copyrighted and require that you own them or you have access to them through a subscription service. You will need to arrange access to physical copies of these texts or to subscribe to services that provide you access to them. (The services you need are noted with the texts below, and you should add those costs to the total costs for this course. No exceptions.) Sadly, both the mainstay word processing applications, Microsoft Word and Apple Pages, are terrible at collaboration, review, and revision. This course uses Google Docs for major writing assignments: please make sure to familiarize yourself with its features and functions at your earliest convenience \u2013 announcing you do not have a Google Drive account or do not how to use it when an assignment is due means you haven\u2019t read the syllabus. I will only interact with drafts either in this format or in plain text using either Markdown or LaTeX via GitHub. (I will also provide you with a standard file-naming scheme for each document I ask you to submit: use it.) Finally, put away the spiral-bound notebooks, especially the multi-subject ones. Get yourself a notepad and a collection of file folders. More will be explained in class, but you should start by reading this note . Course Requirements The goal of the course is to help students learn how to read more closely and with an eye to possible outcomes. Much of the grading of the course then focuses on written products as either documentation of reading practice or as various kinds of outcomes. Everything is in words: sometimes presented orally, and even dramatically, and sometimes scribed. Small writing activities appear constantly throughout this course. They are typically graded for competence and then for excellence. They are worth a total of 30 percent. Participation in class activities and discussions is not simply a matter of being bodily present but of engaging actively, with excitement for the possibilities and respect for others\u2019 efforts. The 20 percent here should not be assumed but earned. COVID Update : No final exam will be given, unless requested by the student one week in advance. The course project will be worth 50 percent of the final grade. The big writing project in this course, worth 30 percent, is graded as a portfolio that may include a proposal, a research report, drafts of various parts of the essay, as well as the essay itself. The project is itself divided up across a number of activities: first body paragraph, second and third body paragraphs, first draft, second draft, and final draft. (Yes, the process really is that involved.) Drafting is so important that it is worth half the grade: drafts must be submitted on time to count. Course Dynamics First, all students should read Rob Jenkins\u2019 essay on \u201cDefining the Relationship.\u201d Jenkins is also a professor of English at a regional state university in the south. His approach is similar to the one in this course. Discussion, completion of assignments, and participation in course activities are an important part of how I structure a course. I prefer not to lecture from any given book so that I can add to our discussion and not repeat material found elsewhere \u2013 if repetition is important to you, then this may not be the course for you. It should also be noted that course discussions, by design, are wide-ranging. I regard class meetings in the same light as most professionals: they are necessary and you must take notes no matter who is talking. (And it goes without saying that you deserve everyone else\u2019s respect, and they deserve yours.) An important part of participation is being in the room on time: every student is spotted three unexcused absences. Thereafter, each absence will remove up to ten percent of the final grade: this is in addition to null values entered for participation and missed assignments. Note-taking is your responsibility, as is keeping up with what is happening or happened in class on a given day or what is due in class following your absence. (Not handing in an assignment because you didn\u2019t know about it because you missed class and did not contact one of your classmates still counts as not handing in the assignment.) Please write down the name and contact information of at least one other member of this class. The university maintains a strict absence policy. If an absence is at all foreseeable, especially if it falls on a due date, you should let me know as much in advance as you can in order to find a solution. The same goes for arriving late or departing early. If you are more than five minutes late, you will not be admitted to class \u2013 unless you have a very good narrative and can perform it with a zeal glimpsed only in performances by Cirque du Soleil or Frank Sinatra. Turn off all sources of distraction before coming into class. Cell phones must be set to silent and put away, unless you are expecting an emergency telephone call, in which case you should talk to me before class starts and sit near an exit so that you can excuse yourself and step outside to take the telephone call. Let me state this again: no cell phones . [Simon Sinek has a good account][] of how cell phones satisfy us and, at the same time, keep us from the kinds of actions that lead to long-term things like relationships and satisfaction. All of you have a copy of the Code of Student Ethics. If you do not, please get one. All forms of academic dishonesty \u2014 e.g., cheating on exams, plagiarism in papers \u2014 will be taken very seriously in this class. At minimum, you will receive an F on the assignment, but there is also the possibility of receiving an F in the course or being dismissed from the university. I personally do not want to consider the possibility of turning over the design of a bridge that my family will cross to an engineer who cheats nor the diagnosis of a medical condition to a doctor who cheats. Many of you are from Louisiana and remain in Louisiana and thus will remain a part of my world: being surrounded by individuals whom I trust and admire is important to me. Please give me every opportunity to do so. Institutional Necessities One day, the University will create a central resource that collects stuff like this, but until then, they ask faculty to include things like this: Emergency Evacuation Procedures A map of this floor is posted near the elevator marking the evacuation route and \u201cDesignated Rescue Area.\u201d Students who need assistance should identify themselves to the instructor. Accessibility Services, Disability Services, & Other Helpful People The university maintains a wide variety of services and centers designed to help students who have either ongoing or emergent needs. Please don\u2019t hesitate to contact any of these folks, http://louisiana.edu/academics/academic-support-services , and don\u2019t be embarrassed to talk to me. Your Secret Identity In some semesters, each student is assigned a \u201csecret identity.\u201d The assignment is purely random: it consists of pairing your name with a some kind of token. Do not share your secret identity with anyone and do not ask anyone to share his/her secret identity with you. It is permissible, however, to design a game within which secret identities are used and thus disclosed. Be prepared for players to balk at anything that requires direct disclosure: your game must be compelling enough that revelation of their secret identity is something they are willing to \u201cpay\u201d in order to play. There is some reward for maintaining your secret identity throughout the semester. (Just some, not a lot.) Course Schedule This course, like all university courses, operates within the larger framework of the university\u2019s schedule, including various breaks and exam periods. Because each class is different, the schedule of assignments is not tied to any particular date but tied to a given sequence of events: Dangerous Games The first few weeks of the semester focus on the short story \u201cThe Most Dangerous Game\u201d (1924) and various ways to break up the text and the work associated with analysis. Text Link \u201cThe Most Dangerous Game\u201d pdf \u201cThe Most Dangerous Game\u201d text Wikipedia entry for story url \u201cThe Most Dangerous Game\u201d (film) youtube Wikipedia entry for film url Assignment : group development and production of an adaptation of \u201cThe Most Dangerous Game\u201d suitable for presentation to the rest of class. Maximum run time of 10 minutes. Please be sure to follow the criteria we develop in class. Arenas Text Link \u201cArena\u201d pdf / text (See Stockwell 2002 for more on storyworlds and inheritance.)

Currently, the following texts are included in our course. They are all available in a folder labeled Texts on the course Moodle site and can be downloaded individually or in bulk. Date Text 1909 E.

Algorithms Concluding his review of Ed Finn\u2019s What Algorithms Want , Scott Selisker notes that: While it\u2019s tempting to imagine algorithms as either impartial bystanders or Daemon- like monsters that might take on lives of their own, seeing them as bigger systems helps us to advocate for more just arrangements and better information. What Algorithms Want explains how we all have a stake in shaping the algorithms that have, for all intents and purposes, already taken over. Course Paper The final paper in this class asks you to reflect on the methodological work we have done in terms of understanding texts and the topical considerations for the term \u2013 in this case how we imagine \u201cartificial intelligence.\u201d Your objective is to complete by the end of the semester an essay which takes up a text, or several texts, that we did not discuss in class and examine it for its representation of how intelligences, human and artificial, relate, reflect, refract a particular concern, anxiety, question or some other topic of your choosing. The paper must be grounded in textual evidence and that evidence must be presented in a contextualized fashion and a considered sequence such that your audience is \u201cnaturally\u201d led from your initial proposition to agreement with your thinking on the matter. Just to be clear, the essay must be 3500 words, which does not include extensive quotations nor your works cited; it must be turned in on paper with one-inch margins, double-spaced, and in a reasonable 12-point serif type face. (If you aren\u2019t sure on any of these parameters, especially type face, check with me. Don\u2019t surprise me.) Your paper must be well-sourced, though I do not require any given minimum nor maximum number of sources. Bibliography Stockwell, Peter. 2002. Cognitive Poetics: An Introduction. Routledge. Moodle .

John Laudun, HLG 356, Tuesdays 9-12 & by appointment, laudun@louisiana.edu Description This iteration of the Introduction to Folklore course is focused on folk narrative. Participants in the course will encounter diverse definitions of and theories about narrative, examine various forms of narrative (with a focus on traditional genres of folklore), collect and document instances of folk narrative, and produce an analytical research report on those materials. Objectives Participants in this course will learn how to read scholarly and scientific definitions and analyses of human nature with a special emphasis on narrative and then apply those definitions or reproduce such analyses in their own thinking and writing. Writing is a significant component of any communication, be it scientific or professional, and participants in this course will be required to assume those voices necessary to accomplishing a particular task. In addition, as a course in folklore studies participants will also create documentation containing both metadata and data in appropriate markup, which may or may not include things like XML. Requirements As an upper-division course, this course assumes all participants are already familiar with accessing and using scholarly and scientific materials in both print and on-line forms. If not, then your first course of action is to schedule a library tour and/or take a tutorial. (See Resources for links.) It also assumes you are familiar with the University\u2019s Code of Conduct, and you are familiar with being an adult. This class is conducted as if we are are all professionals engaged in a mutually rewarding endeavor to which all of us contribute in order to succeed. That means coming prepared, not being distracted, and being engaged with not only the course materials but also each other. Running counter to the in loco parentis impulse of many other dimensions of the university, this course has a limited set of tasks with a grading framework that attempts to be as clear, and simple, as possible. For this semester, the overall schedule of graded assignments are: Assignment Value Informal Assignments & Pop Quizzes 10% of overall grade and 10 points each with the possibility may displace exams in importance (and percentages) Participation 20% of overall grade Exams 20% of overall grade Text Collection (This documentation be complete and recordings turned in and logged.) 25% of overall grade Research Report 25% of overall grade From the table, you can see that two most important outputs are the text collection and the research report. For the purposes of scheduling, it should be noted that the text collection is due at the beginning of April and the research report on the last day of classes. (This latter deadline is quite strict for reasons external to the course.) Texts A considerable amount of reading for this course are scholarly materials, mostly as PDFs, available either in on-line databases, like JSTOR, or through the course\u2019s Moodle site. Many of the materials in the latter instance are already uploaded, and so if there is a moment in the course where an item is listed on the schedule but does not appear in the Resources section of the course\u2019s Moodle page, please contact me. (Do not assume because you cannot find something that you are not responsible for it.) Please note that the list of books to be purchased is currently a work in progress.

Resources In addition to the texts we encounter in class, there are other resources both in folklore studies and in narratology that may be useful to those either in need of a bit more discussion or seeking to expand their understanding. JSTOR offers a variety of tutorials: some are simply slides or texts that you can read on your own and others are interactive tutorials hosted on their own Moodle setup. (Registration is required, but once you are registered, you\u2019ll discover a number of short videos as well as interactive exercises. If you allocate 20 minutes per session for a few days, you\u2019ll learn something.) In case you are unclear, there is a difference between primary and secondary sources in many fields, though the distinction can be blurry in disciplines, like folklore studies and cultural anthropology, that create their own source materials.

Some Fine Print Much of the information to be gleaned from the formal instruction in this course is in the lectures I give, the discussions we have, and the documentaries we view. That means that attendance is foundational to a student\u2019s success in this course. What happens in any given class of this course cannot be found anywhere else. If you must miss a class, please contact one of the people whose names you entered in this syllabus for notes on what you missed. Why is attendance important? Because there is no, at least not yet, good guide to Louisiana folklore, and because folklore itself is dynamic and because I tailor materials to each course in an effort to make this stuff as relevant to you, as actual people, as it is humanly possible to do, a lot of the course material is available only as lectures and class discussions. You need to be there to get it, and you need to take notes. On both lectures and discussions. I do not provide my lecture notes. The principle reason is pedagogical: a number of studies have shown that we learn best when we make notes for ourselves. (It\u2019s less important that we consult notes later, than it is we take them in the first place.) The marginal reason is that my notes do not necessarily make sense to anyone but myself\u2014one word, for me, can reference an entire network or outline of ideas and facts that I wish to convey. Additionally, it cannot be emphasized enough that this is a class in folk culture, which is typically learned, practically by definition, outside the sphere of formal instruction. This course is designed to provide, within the walls of the classroom, students with a basic grounding in the theory of folklore studies, the principle dynamics of most folk cultures, the history that informs Louisiana\u2019s folk cultural matrix, and particular examples drawn from particular Louisiana folk cultures. All of this will be foundational to your understanding and appreciation of either the folk cultures with which you grew up and/or in which you now find yourself immersed. No understanding will be complete without any experience of folk culture itself. A number of the activities in this class require students to interact with practitioners of a Louisiana folk culture. For most, this is typically family and friends, but it could be mean, for some, having to interview individuals you know less well. Please be sensible in doing this. Because all experience unfolds across time, often a significant amount of time, students must be prepared to spend time outside of class, interacting with others in a thoughtful way that respects not only others but that this experience is a part of their own education. A lack of seriousness and a lack of respect for all involved \u2014 instructor, one\u2019s self, fellow students, folk practitioners \u2014 represents a failure to grasp the root ideas and issues of folklore studies and of this course. Students displaying a lack of respect will find themselves in conference with the instructor and then the dean of students. Part of taking yourself, your learning, and this course seriously is that you agree to all the rules and guidelines on academic honesty laid out in the Student Bulletin. Plagiarism and cheating in this course will result, at the very least, in failure of the assignment; it can also mean failing the course immediately and, potentially, expulsion from the university. If in doubt about what to do or how to handle material not your own in your work, please see me. Helping you to figure that stuff out is part of my job. That said, part of our effort to have the best possible classroom experience is leaving other things outside: pagers, cell phones, food, drinks, materials for other classes, etc. Please turn off any and all of these devices before entering the classroom. If yours go off, you will be excused from class. You are, however, permitted to use a laptop computer for taking notes \u2014 do not abuse your time, my time, or UWIN surfing the web (again, you will be excused from class immediately) as well as an audio recorder. Please do note that I regularly incorporate a variety of copyrighted material within my lectures that may or may not be indicated in the course of a lecture, and that any remaining materials are copyrighted by me. By granting you permission to record lectures, I do so with the understanding that the recordings will only be for your use and only your use in the pursuit of your education. You may not share copyrighted materials with others. By the same token, I take your intellectual productivity and property equally seriously. Students who generate quality documentation of a person, place, event, or behavior are regularly encouraged to submit their materials to the Archives of Cajun and Creole Folklore. I may also ask a student for permission to retain a copy of your materials for use in future classes. I try to return materials in an orderly fashion, but time sometimes works against such efforts. Any and all materials belonging to you that are left in my possession at the end of the semester will probably be disposed in the first few weeks of the following semester unless you indicate otherwise \u2014 I simply don\u2019t have room to store all student materials forever in my tiny office.","title":"332 - Introduction to Folklore"},{"location":"332/#introduction-to-folklore","text":"ENGL 332-001, MWF 11:00 AM - 11:50 AM, HLG 321 Pr.

John Laudun MW 11:00-11:30 and by appointment laudun@louisiana.edu COVID Update : The course is in the middle of being revised for remote delivery. See the university\u2019s COVID guidelines for more information. Description Memes , fake news , trolling , rickrolling are all well-established forms of internet behavior and are as much a part of our everyday lives as grandma\u2019s gumbo. English 334 explores the varieties and depths of digital cultures, from the first email forwards to the latest tiktoks and everything in between. Course activities include curating collections of multimedia materials; learning how to parse digital content; annotating, sorting, and compiling data sets; applying appropriate analytical frameworks; and exploring ways to present your ideas effectively. The course includes producing an online portfolio and learning collaborative and versioning systems to make it possible to work with others as well as secure your own work. Objectives Participants in this course will learn how to read scholarly and scientific analyses of human behavior with a special emphasis on online behaviors and then apply definitions, models, or analytical concepts in their own thinking and writing. Writing is a significant component of any communication, be it scientific or professional, and participants in this course will be required to assume those voices necessary to accomplishing a particular task. In addition, as a course in folklore studies participants will also create documentation containing both metadata and data in appropriate markup, which may or may not include things like XML. Requirements As an upper-division course, this course assumes all participants are already familiar with accessing and using scholarly and scientific materials in both print and on-line forms. If not, then your first course of action is to take a library tutorial. (See also the guide on how to access JSTOR , and other resources, from off campus.) It also assumes you are familiar with the University\u2019s Code of Conduct. This class is conducted as if we are are all professionals engaged in a mutually rewarding endeavor to which all of us contribute in order to succeed. That means coming prepared, not being distracted, and being engaged with not only the course materials but also each other. The schedule of graded assignments is: Participation (20%) requires active participation in discussions and activities. This will be more difficult in an online session, but we all need to figure this out. An important dimension of learning is voicing your ideas either orally or in writing, which is often far easier in conversation than it is in the more formal setting of an assignment. Use these opportunities to your best advantage \u2013 and let me know to make it better for you. Assignments (30%): each unit we cover has a corresponding documentation assignment (see below). Exams (20%): there are two exams which ask you to take concepts and methods taken from the readings and apply them in a very constrained way to novel examples or to examples from another reading. If you\u2019ve kept up with the reading, lectures, and discussions, these are pretty straightforward. Project (30%): Drawing upon the ideas, forms, and materials we have discussed this course expects you to strike out on your own, gathering your own data set. analyzing it, and bringing appropriate (and novel) ideas and concepts to bear. The project takes place over the last four weeks of the course with staged entries, almost all of which are shared with other course participants, including submission of an abstract , a draft collection , and a draft (itself a sequence), ahead of submitting the final draft as well as a final presentation \u2013 this can be a pre-recorded affair, if you like. (That\u2019s a lot, and it\u2019s possible one of the exams may go away as a result.) Course Project The parameters below are for the final product: there is no expectation that you will have this many words, or perhaps that many examples, when you start \u2013 though, to be honest, having many examples to start is better. As a folklorist, I study anecdotes. Anecdotes are the stuff of life. They can even be objects of study. You just can\u2019t work with anecdotal evidence, in the sense that a small number of examples \u2014- sometimes only one \u2013 drawn from personal experience can serve as your data. It\u2019s perfectly fine to let your personal experience draw you towards an object of study, but once you have established that object, you need to collect (and analyze) objectively and purposefully; not casually, anecdotally. The minimum number of examples for any project is ten . The final word count, barring any included texts and their basic description, is 1500. 1500 words of solid analytical and conceptual prose with plenty of accommodations for rich, meaningful descriptions and pattern discovery. (Please do not narrate your research process save as a way to start your essay or to conclude it.) The final presentation should 3-5 minutes in length and it should provide the audience with the essentials: the scope of the research, the conclusions drawn, and how those conclusions were reached (what was the data, how was it examined, what additional materials or concepts were found to be necessary). The initial abstract should be ~100 words and provide its audience with the materials to be considered and some idea of what makes them compelling to think about (and, later, to read about). Documentation of a Digital Artifact The artifact itself must be appropriately and fully captured at its native resolution or higher and in a share-able format: JPG is acceptable for images, though PNG is better \u2013 professional researchers rely on TIFF. This goes for textual materials as well: their native context should be captured either as a partial screen capture on the web site or as a capture of the browser window. (No one wants to see your entire desktop, trust me.) If capturing a browser window, insure there are no embarrassing tabs to be seen. (In other words, don\u2019t make yourself a meme.) Record the URL and relevant metadata like date and time of access \u2013 feel free to add the platform used. Describe the artifact in your own words such that a reader need not see it to understand what it is. This may mean significant re-typing of verbal information,be it audio or textual, or time spent describing an image or video sequence. Some Prompts There are many ways to make presentations more compelling. Here are a few ideas to get you started: Scientific American \u2018s 60-Second Science series is billed as a podcast, and thus depends upon audio, but episodes regularly feature visuals \u2013 usually just one, and it\u2019s not a slide of bullet points but more often an image or a graph which is explained during the course of the episode. Multi-panel comic. Timeline of/with images. miniTEDtalk Horrible Histories sometimes features songs . Required Texts A considerable amount of reading for this course are scholarly materials, mostly as PDFs, available either in on-line databases, like JSTOR, or through the course\u2019s Moodle site. Many of the materials in the latter instance are already uploaded, and so if there is a moment in the course where an item is listed on the schedule but does not appear in the Resources section of the course\u2019s Moodle page, please contact me. (Do not assume because you cannot find something that you are not responsible for it.) At present, I am only considering one book as a required purchase for this course: Gretchen McCulloch\u2019s Because Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language . More on this soon. In addition to the texts we encounter in class, there are other resources that may be useful to those either in need of a bit more discussion or seeking to expand their understanding. JSTOR, for example, offers a variety of tutorials: some are simply slides or texts that you can read on your own and others are interactive tutorials hosted on their own Moodle setup. (Registration is required, but once you are registered, you\u2019ll discover a number of short videos as well as interactive exercises. If you allocate 20 minutes per session for a few days, you\u2019ll learn something.) In case you are unclear, there is a difference between primary and secondary sources in many fields, though the distinction can be blurry in disciplines, like folklore studies and cultural anthropology, that create their own source materials. Contact Information Do not hesitate. Immediately look around where you are sitting and get the name and number of two responsible looking people. Not the cute one \u2014 because getting his or her number that way would be just creepy, but someone who has at least your level of maturity, if not higher. Write that information below so that when you do have to miss class, then you can contact them about what you missed.

See the university\u2019s COVID guidelines for more information. Course Description The course is designed to introduce participants to the basics of folklore studies, both through an initial \u201cbootcamp\u201d as well as through ongoing readings \u2013 some as a focus for conversation, others as sidebars, and then to explore the way that America is socially constructed through stories we tell, sometimes to cheer ourselves on, and sometimes to scare ourselves silly. As an advanced course for undergraduates and a foundational course for graduate students, this course attempts to address folk materials and dynamics in terms of rhetorical effectiveness, literary/generic structure, and cultural history. Some students will be interested in the theory that will be used, albeit lightly, throughout the course, and non-folklorists interested in American literature and culture will find the historical dimensions critical to understanding certain genres/topics of American fiction. The goal of this course is to examine online, and offline, legends and understand the sources, both structural and referential, upon which they draw. Social media will be one of our foci, and as such this course highlights that media, first, has always been social, and that, second, the social world has always been mediated. Because of the personal nature of much of social media, participants in this course will need to have an open mind about the nature of meaning, and, just as importantly, about the varieties of human experience and perception. Much of the material in this course reveals the anxieties and fears, the prejudices and blindnesses, that humans too often carry with them and rarely communicate directly, only allowing them to slip out indirectly, in stories and assertions that manifest what are often tangled knots of things thought and/or felt. In some cases, the knots are not pretty. Course Requirements For matters of daily comportment and responsibility, please see The Essentials . Texts A great deal of the readings are scholarly in nature and will be available either as links to JSTOR and Project Muse or through the course\u2019s Moodle site, either as PDFs or as links to sites. In addition to the on-line materials, there are a few books required for this course. Those titles will be given to you within the first few weeks of classes. Expect to purchase between 2 and 4 books, so be sure to set aside a portion of your budget for that expense, in addition to the cost of printing other materials as needed. Assignments The assignment schedule for this course is simple: participation, exams, and a course project. Participation is worth 20% of your grade. Each of the exams is worth 15%; and the course project is worth the remaining 50%. Participation can be a source of confusion. Does it mean just showing up? Showing up is understood: an advanced course depends upon all of us being in the room (on time) and being prepared to discuss the topic at hand. A 400-level course in the humanities is not a data dump, but an opportunity to absorb new material, digest it, use it to analyze old and new points of information, and create new forms of knowledge that may be interesting or valuable to no one else but yourself. Active engagement with the materials, the topics, and others is requisite to achieve full marks in participation. The course project requires independent enterprise on the part of course participants, who are free to choose from a wide variety of topics, so long as they can make a case to me both in the intial proposal and in the paper itself that it fits within the scope of the course. The wide possible scope is on purpose, but negotiating the parameters of the project with the instructor is required . In order to encourage participants to take full advantage of the course\u2019s lengthy drafting process, half of the project\u2019s final grade, or 25% of the overall grade, is based on completion of the drafting process, which in many instances is no more than turning in the required items on time. Full credit, full stop. (Looking for a project? There\u2019s always 50 Hottest Urban Legends on Snopes .) Please note that this is an advanced undergraduate, foundational graduate course in the humanities: our focus is on texts. Please make sure that any work you turn in for evaluation is similarly focused. The exams are what they are, though they are sometimes replaced with take-home writing assignments to be completed by a specified deadline. Resources A lot of collections of \u201cAmerican folklore\u201d have been published over the years, each with its own assumptions about both \u201cAmerica\u201d and \u201cfolklore\u201d as well as what the purpose of such a collection should be. Typical of one kind of collection are those by Charles Skinner, whose Myths and Legends of Our Own Land reaches 9 volumes. A more synthetic, and more contemporary, reference can be found in the American Folklore: An Encyclopedia , edited by Jan Brunvand, a copy of which is available in the university library (Reference GR101.A54). While dated by contemporary scholarly perspectives, the collection of essays in Don Yoder\u2019s American Folklife (GR105.A6) is still quite useful, and foundational in many ways. In addition to reference works focused on the topic of American folklore, there are a myriad of other specialist reference works, many of which are available either in electronic formats or in the library for your use. Consider the following titles: The Greenwood Encyclopedia of African American Folklore , Encyclopedia of Asian American Folklore and Folklife , the Encyclopedia of Life Writing , The Greenwood Encyclopedia of World Folklore and Folklife are all the kinds of entry texts, being encyclopedias that will be familiar to your freshman/sophomore self but will also get your junior/senior/graduate self on the road to more serious and substantial work. That is, in addition to a synthesis/summary of a topic from a particular perspective, most scholarly encyclopedias also offer a small number of suggested readings. Please follow through on those readings the way you would a link on a web page. Institutional Necessities One day, the University will create a central resource that collects stuff like this, but until then, they ask faculty to include things like this: Emergency Evacuation Procedures A map of this floor is posted near the elevator marking the evacuation route and \u201cDesignated Rescue Area.\u201d Students who need assistance should identify themselves to the instructor. Accessibility Services, Disability Services, & Other Helpful People The university maintains a wide variety of services and centers designed to help students who have either ongoing or emergent needs. Please don\u2019t hesitate to contact any of these folks, http://louisiana.edu/academics/academic-support-services , and don\u2019t be embarrassed to talk to me. Course Agenda Please note two things: First, that this course does not follow a fixed, calendrical schedule, but, rather, an agenda. If you miss class, reach out to one of your contacts to ascertain where we are in the agenda. Second, in most cases, the direct link to an article or other kind of resource is posted in this course. In a number of instances, the direct link is to JSTOR, since that is where a number of folklore studies journals are archived. Please see the note on accessing materials for more information on successfully accessing databases and data repositories. Introductions For those interested in exploring the materials drawn upon for the introductory lecture, and the founding assumptions of this course, the following brief bibliography offers some first steps: Bateson, Gregory. 1972.

Burke, Kenneth. 1941. Literature as Equipment for Living. In The Philosophy of Literary Form , 293-304. University of California Press. URL . Matters of \u201cFact\u201d As Wikipedia notes: The Day the Universe Changed is a British documentary television series written and presented by science historian James Burke, originally broadcast on BBC1 in [Spring] 1985 by the BBC [and rebroadcast on PBS in Autumn 1986]. The series\u2019 primary focus is on the effect of advances in science and technology on western society in its philosophical aspects. The title comes from the philosophical idea that the universe essentially only exists as one perceives it through what one knows; therefore, if one changes one\u2019s perception of the universe with new knowledge, one has essentially changed the universe itself. To illustrate this concept, James Burke tells the various stories of important scientific discoveries and technological advances and how they fundamentally altered how western civilization perceives the world. The series runs in roughly chronological order, from around the beginning of the Middle Ages to the present. (Wikipedia also has a nice entry on the printing press .) Legend Foundations Bascom, William. 1965. The Forms of Folklore: Prose Narratives. Journal of American Folklore 78: 3-20. JSTOR .

Journal of American Folklore 78(307): 21-27. DOI: 10.2307/538100. JSTOR . Another essay that works well with Bascom\u2019s \u201cForms of Folklore\u201d is his essay on the four functions of folklore : Bascom, William. 1953. Four Functions of Folklore.

It\u2019s worth taking a look: the landing page is not very informative, but if you search for something like rumor than you get a very nice history of its study represented in the search results.

Death by Folklore: Ostension, Contemporary Legend, and Murder. Western Folklore 48 (3): 201-220. JSTOR . Legends as Performances In addition to thinking about folklore qua texts, folklorists have also developed a robust model of folklore as transactional in nature: folklore was \u201cequipment for living\u201d (Kenneth Burke) or folklore as a way to get social business done. Some describe this as a contextual approach, but the term most often associated with it is performance. The articles below focus on the nature of contexts: Bauman, Richard. 1972.

Origgi, Gloria. 2018. Say goodbye to the information age: it\u2019s all about reputation now. Aeon (March 14). URL . We are experiencing a fundamental paradigm shift in our relationship to knowledge. From the \u2018information age\u2019, we are moving towards the \u2018reputation age\u2019, in which information will have value only if it is already filtered, evaluated and commented upon by others. Seen in this light, reputation has become a central pillar of collective intelligence today. It is the gatekeeper to knowledge, and the keys to the gate are held by others. The way in which the authority of knowledge is now constructed makes us reliant on what are the inevitably biased judgments of other people, most of whom we do not know.

As an advanced course for undergraduates and a foundational course for graduate students, this course attempts to address folk materials and dynamics in terms of rhetorical effectiveness, literary/generic structure, and cultural history. Some students will be interested in the theory that will be used, albeit lightly, throughout the course, and non-folklorists interested in American literature and culture will find the historical dimensions critical to understanding certain genres/topics of American fiction. The goal of this course is to examine online, and offline, legends and understand the sources, both structural and referential, upon which they draw. Social media will be one of our foci, and as such this course highlights that media, first, has always been social, and that, second, the social world has always been mediated. Because of the personal nature of much of social media, participants in this course will need to have an open mind about the nature of meaning, and, just as importantly, about the varieties of human experience and perception. Much of the material in this course reveals the anxieties and fears, the prejudices and blindnesses, that humans too often carry with them and rarely communicate directly, only allowing them to slip out indirectly, in stories and assertions that manifest what are often tangled knots of things thought and/or felt. In some cases, the knots are not pretty.","title":"Course Description"},{"location":"432/#course-requirements","text":"For matters of daily comportment and responsibility, please see The Essentials .","title":"Course Requirements"},{"location":"432/#texts","text":"A great deal of the readings are scholarly in nature and will be available either as links to JSTOR and Project Muse or through the course\u2019s Moodle site, either as PDFs or as links to sites.

Participation is worth 20% of your grade. Each of the exams is worth 15%; and the course project is worth the remaining 50%. Participation can be a source of confusion. Does it mean just showing up? Showing up is understood: an advanced course depends upon all of us being in the room (on time) and being prepared to discuss the topic at hand. A 400-level course in the humanities is not a data dump, but an opportunity to absorb new material, digest it, use it to analyze old and new points of information, and create new forms of knowledge that may be interesting or valuable to no one else but yourself. Active engagement with the materials, the topics, and others is requisite to achieve full marks in participation. The course project requires independent enterprise on the part of course participants, who are free to choose from a wide variety of topics, so long as they can make a case to me both in the intial proposal and in the paper itself that it fits within the scope of the course. The wide possible scope is on purpose, but negotiating the parameters of the project with the instructor is required . In order to encourage participants to take full advantage of the course\u2019s lengthy drafting process, half of the project\u2019s final grade, or 25% of the overall grade, is based on completion of the drafting process, which in many instances is no more than turning in the required items on time. Full credit, full stop. (Looking for a project? There\u2019s always 50 Hottest Urban Legends on Snopes .) Please note that this is an advanced undergraduate, foundational graduate course in the humanities: our focus is on texts.

Typical of one kind of collection are those by Charles Skinner, whose Myths and Legends of Our Own Land reaches 9 volumes. A more synthetic, and more contemporary, reference can be found in the American Folklore: An Encyclopedia , edited by Jan Brunvand, a copy of which is available in the university library (Reference GR101.A54). While dated by contemporary scholarly perspectives, the collection of essays in Don Yoder\u2019s American Folklife (GR105.A6) is still quite useful, and foundational in many ways. In addition to reference works focused on the topic of American folklore, there are a myriad of other specialist reference works, many of which are available either in electronic formats or in the library for your use. Consider the following titles: The Greenwood Encyclopedia of African American Folklore , Encyclopedia of Asian American Folklore and Folklife , the Encyclopedia of Life Writing , The Greenwood Encyclopedia of World Folklore and Folklife are all the kinds of entry texts, being encyclopedias that will be familiar to your freshman/sophomore self but will also get your junior/senior/graduate self on the road to more serious and substantial work.

The series\u2019 primary focus is on the effect of advances in science and technology on western society in its philosophical aspects. The title comes from the philosophical idea that the universe essentially only exists as one perceives it through what one knows; therefore, if one changes one\u2019s perception of the universe with new knowledge, one has essentially changed the universe itself. To illustrate this concept, James Burke tells the various stories of important scientific discoveries and technological advances and how they fundamentally altered how western civilization perceives the world.

In addition to (or over and against) scholarly/scientific considerations of narrative, the seminar will develop its own corpus of texts which we will use as a place to apply theories and models, as a vehicle for furthering/deepening our discussion about various theories and models, and as a well from which we can draw our own ideas. For more on the corpus, see below . Requirements Participation Seminar participants are expected to comport themselves as, well, as if they were in a seminar: A seminar is, generally, a form of academic instruction, either at an academic institution or offered by a commercial or professional organization. It has the function of bringing together small groups for recurring meetings, focusing each time on some particular subject, in which everyone present is requested to participate actively. This is often accomplished through an ongoing Socratic dialogue with a seminar leader or instructor, or through a more formal presentation of research. The idea behind the seminar system is to familiarize students more extensively with the methodology of their chosen subject and also to allow them to interact with examples of the practical problems that always occur during research work. It is essentially a place where assigned readings are discussed, questions can be raised and debates can be conducted. (Thank you, Wikipedia.) Participation includes a wide variety of forms: active listening, thoughtful speaking, short presentations, involvement in in-class and out-of-class individual and group assignments. Some of these may include, as seems fitting for a seminar led by a folklorist, the occasional exploration of the world beyond campus in the form of observations you make in places like book stores, coffee shops, and other places where people gather to talk or read/write. There is no set list of assignments in this regard: this is something that must arise out of a sense of the seminar as a particular historical group of individuals. (Again, you would expect no less an assertion from a folklorist.) In addition to the assumed active participation, which includes a number of projects and/or assignments as well as active listening and talking, this seminar also requires the preparation and presentation of a conference paper ( >= 2500 words) and a seminar paper ( >= 7500 words). The idea behind this particular arrangement is that the conference paper will be due before the seminar paper, giving participants an advanced deadline that makes it possible to test the viability of an idea and to have time to expand the paper into something of consequence that we call the seminar paper and we often imagine as leading to an article. That is, both the written assignments in this seminar are designed to match conventional scholarly outputs. (We will have more to discuss \u2013 e.g., how sometimes expanding a conference presentation is harder than shrinking a research paper or what to do when a project implodes at the presentation stage \u2013 during the course of the seminar.) (See the project description below for more information.) The weighting of grades will be as follows: participation in the seminar, which includes short in-seminar presentations and activities, makes up one half of a participant\u2019s evaluation. The conference paper and the seminar paper make up the other half. I hold out any weighting of the two for the following reason: it is entirely possible that the conference paper goes nowhere. If that is the case, first, good. Failure is one way to learn, and it is better to have a project blow up in the smaller form of the conference paper than to fall apart halfway through the seminar paper. Hence, should the conference paper go awry, it should matter less in any final evaluation. The same goes for the seminar paper. This is an educational setting: failure must be an option. (Not trying is not.) Corpus Because time is not infinite, each of you is constrained by a limit of 10,000 words: this can be one text or several. A further constraint is that we will need to balance our text between those items that are obviously or conventionally narrative and those which test boundaries. My somewhat informed guess is that many of you already have possible sources, which could range as wildly from the tried and true of Project Gutenberg or An Archive of Our Own to sites and sources which I cannot imagine. Just in case, here are some lists drawn from rambling around the \u201cintarwebs\u201d that might help you when you get stuck: Open Culture lists 800 Free eBooks for iPad, Kindle & Other Devices . ( Open Culture regularly compiles such lists, so it\u2019s worth searching for topics or titles that interest you to see what they may have already compiled in a \u201clisticle\u201d \u2013 Katherine Kinnaird and I got started on our work on TED talks thanks to an OC article about a list of the talks.) NothingintheRuleBook has 55 places you can download tens of thousands books, plays and other literary texts completely legally for free . Project For most participants, writing a seminar paper in a course focused on intellectual history is fairly difficult: usually the moment of person syntehsis, that ah-hah! moment, comes in the latter half of the term. That is not terrible timing for a seminar paper, but for attempting anything earlier, it does make things difficult. Based on past experience, I would like to propose that you begin with a research proposal with the following contents: a one-paragraph (200-500 words) statement of the texts in which you are interested and the theories or models through which you would like to explore them. This is only a preliminary sketch, nothing more. You are putting words down because getting words down is, first, always a good thing, and words beget words, also a good thing. If you\u2019d like to break this into more paragraphs, feel free. a bibliography , again preliminary/draft in nature, which is divided into two parts: the texts which you wish to examine and the texts which will serve as your analytical and/or theoretical paradigms and/or models. The more you annotate each of these, the better \u2013 you need to get used to, and good at, explaining yourself to interested but non-expert others. Write like you are talking to a class of undergraduates, interested undergraduates. Single-spaced and citations in whatever formatting your prefer, but used consistently. (For the record, folklore studies uses Chicago B, which makes far more sense than MLA and has not changed in decades.) Let\u2019s make the proposals due next Wednesday, March 20. Agenda Our own interests, expertise, and discoveries will determine more clearly how we will actually spend our time. For those reasons, I prefer to establish an agenda for a course, with the proviso that how much we dwell on a topic or gloss it will effect the timing of matters. While the sequencing of topics should remain fairly stable, the fulfillment of those topics through various readings will be determined by the content of our conversations. A Bayesian Introduction to Narrative Studies The first task in any course with some dimension of intellectual history as its focus is to try to understand the overall history of the domain. Narrative, however, is a relatively recent locus for organizing scholarly and scientific investigation. Prior to its development as a subject of study in the twentieth century, narrative was largely viewed through a lens of other objects \u2013 tragic plays, novels, myths. While a seminar of this nature could spend a considerable amount of time in the period prior to the formalist-structuralist articulation of narrative as an object in its own right, we are going to bounce around a bit, hoping, in some shadow of Bayes, to locate ourselves through apparent random pings in the great depths of intellectual history. We begin with two readings, one a narrative, and one a scholarly examination: McConnell, Richard. 1924. The Most Dangerous Game. Collier\u2019s . [Moodle]. For those interested in the sheer volume of adaptations of the story, the Wikipedia entry for the short story has a decent, if not complete (because impossible), list. Schiffrin, Deborah. 2009. Crossing Boundaries: The Nexus of Time, Space, Person, and Place in Narrative. Language in Society 38 (4): 421\u201345. DOI:10.1017/S0047404509990212. JSTOR . Burke, Kenneth. 1973/1941. Literature as Equipment for Living. In The Philosophy of Literary Form , 293-304. University of California Press. [Moodle]. Finally, before we leap into our own exploration of the development of narrative studies, it won\u2019t hurt to read some surveys and develop some sense of the larger landscape. For this, there are two encyclopedias, one you know and one you are less likely to know. The first entry for \u201cNarratology\u201d is in Wikipedia , and the second in the Living Handbook of Narratology . The former is short; the latter long. Unitizing Narrative: Motifs & Functions Before we examine Propp\u2019s work, it\u2019s important to understand the larger dialogue in which he is engaging. Specifically, early in Morphology , Propp notes that \u201cthe study of the tale has been pursued for the most part only genetically, and, to a great extent, without attempts at preliminary, systematic description\u201d (5). Genetic references the great philological collection projects of the nineteenth century that were, for the most part, focused on origins and originals. In the twentieth century, that focus would become what is now known as the historic-geographic method, and its most noted accomplishment are the great indices of folklore studies: the tale-type index and the motif index. The best way to understand them is to use them. (More on genetic matters below.) The Indices The Aarne-Thompson-Uther classification system is available on-line as part of the Multilingual Folk Tale Database . A concise explanation of the ATU system is offered here . In preparation for actually using the two iconic folklore indices, I would suggest the following reading: Again, Wikipedia is not a terrible place to start. And there are two other online sources that are worth your time: Richard Kuehnel and Rado Lencek. What is a Folklore Motif? How to use Thompson\u2019s Folklore Motif Index Two of the Grimms tales are available entirely in plain text for your use: Grimms 91 , sometimes titled as \u201cThe Gnome\u201d and sometimes as \u201cThe Elves\u201d and \u201cJack and the Fire Dragon\u201d as told by Ray Hicks. This seminar would be remiss if you did not read about the idea of motif from the compiler himself, Stith Thompson. I have also included Angela Maniak\u2019s short introduction to the role of the role of indexes, or indices, and bibliographies in classical forms of scholarship for those less acquainted with them. Finally, the long essay by Dan Ben-Amos is for those committed to understanding the nuances of folklore studies\u2019 intellectual history. Thompson, Stith. 1949. Motif. In Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology and Legend , 753. Eds. Maria Leach and Jerome Fried. Funk and Wagnalls. [Moodle]. Maniak, Angela. 1983. Bibliographies and Indexes in American Folklore Research. In Handbook of American Folklore, ed. Richard Dorson, 447-451. Indiana University Press. [Moodle]. Ben-Amos, Dan. 1980. The Concept of Motif in Folklore. In Folklore studies in the Twentieth Century: Proceedings of the Centenary Conference of the Folklore Society, ed. Venetia Newall, 17-36. Rowman and Littlefield. [Moodle]. A slightly different approach to unitizing narrative, but proceeding along the same lines as the historic-geographic school, can be found in the work of Jamshid J. Tehrani , who has parsed narratives into traits that look a lot like motifs and then attempted phylogenetic analysis on variations on a text to see which are more closely related. His analysis takes place against a backdrop of history and cultural geography. Gra\u00e7a da Silva, S. & Tehrani, J. J. 2016. Comparative phylogenetic analyses uncover the ancient roots of Indo-European folktales. Royal Society Open Science 3(1): 150645. DOI: 10.1098/rsos.150645. URL Tehrani, J. J. 2013. The Phylogeny of Little Red Riding Hood. PLoS ONE 8(11): e78871. DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0078871. URL . Propp The intertwined, and yet not intersecting, history of motifs and functions is not one on which I can comment. Structuralists outside folklore studies never took up the motif, and folkorists, while fascinated with function, never developed the idea much. Propp\u2019s Morphology, however, has enjoyed a renaissance of late. (It is perhaps because the kinds of data and analysis needed for structuralism has finally come to be \u2013 see Miranda for more.) Propp, Vladimir. 1968. Morphology of the Folktale . Tr. Laurence Scott. University of Texas Press. [Moodle]. And here are some Louisiana legends to consider. (For a text analytical perspective, the corpus is also on Voyant-Tools ) Contemporary considerations of Propp include: Fisseni, Bernhard, Aadil Kurji, and Benedikt L\u00f6we. 2014.

The motif is one of those things that seems old-fashioned and yet has renewed interest in the era of data science (for a variety of reasons). In computer science, Mark Finlayson has done some remarkable work \u2013 see his profile page for a complete bibliography \u2013 but those works directly related to Propp are below. (Please note that computer science, like the sciences in general, is really good about making their work easily accessible: the obsession with tying any work up with protections is the best path to obscurity, literal and figurative.)

The Other Structuralism For those familiar with Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, it might surprise you to learn that while his early work on kinship had established him in the academy, his rise to star status actually emerged from his memoir, Tristes Tropiques , published in the same year, 1955, as \u201cThe Structural Study of Myth\u201d (below). The essay was one stepping stone \u2013 others are collected in Structural Anthropology \u2013 to his longer treatment of myth in La Pens\u00e9e Sauvage (1964, translated as The Savage Mind in English, which, as is usual for translations of Levi-Strauss, and later Derrida, misses the linguistic play often at the heart of his writing).

Classical Narratology While we will return to the idea that narratives are a distinct form of discourse, or a particular mode of discursive production, if you prefer, Barthes\u2019 \u201cIntroduction to the Structural Analysis of Narratives\u201d captures some of the spirit of one of the pivotal moments in the shaping of narrative as a subject of study and will, for many participants, give some hint of what the formalist-structuralist paradigm looks like. Barthes\u2019 \u201cIntroduction to the Structural Analysis of Narratives\u201d first appeared in Communications 8 in 1966. (We are reading the translation published in NLH in 1975. Another translation (into English) can be found in Image Music Text , published in 1977.) Communications was a pathbreaking French journal, and this issue featured essays by Greimas, Bremond, Metz, Todorov, and Genette, all of whom were well on their way to becoming some of the more important figures in structuralism and/or narrative studies. They are typically grouped together for their combined debts to a variety of sources which are easily confused for readers otherwise unfamiliar with the broader intellectual history of the twentieth century. Greimas et al. drew upon structural linguistics (as articulated by Saussure and Benveniste), the Prague School (most notably the work of Roman Jakobson), Russian formalism (particularly Propp but also Bakhtin, Medvedev, among others), structural anthropology (as advanced by Claude Levi-Strauss but also found in the work of Mauss).

Outside the Tower One of the reasons for this course is the immense amount of discourse focused on stories and storytelling that takes places outside the academy. Some of it, as we have seen, is just that story is the current buzzword, much like paradigm and/or box were in a previous moment. There is, however, a lot of very smart thinking about the shapes of stories taking place. TVTropes is one venue, but writers, readers, and critics of genre fiction also have some very interesting, and often quite compelling things to note about the nature of narrative. One place to start is this analysis of the final battle in the middle movie of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, aka Helms Deep. The Nerdwriter\u2019s analysis includes the notion of beats , something you will find used elsewhere. Resources The lists below are by no means comprehensive, only suggestive. If you find something that should be added here, please let me know. Journals Please note that the hyperlinks for JSTOR and Project Muse take you directly to the journal\u2019s main page and not the home page of those two services. The Journal of Narrative Theory appears to be the oldest journal focused specifically on narrative. Founded in 1971 as the Journal of Narrative Technique , JNT \u201chas provided a forum for the theoretical exploration of narrative in all its forms. Building on this foundation, JNT publishes essays addressing the epistemological, global, historical, formal, and political dimensions of narrative from a variety of methodological and theoretical perspectives.\u201d JNT is available on-line through Project Muse. Narrative is \u201cthe official journal of the International Society for the Study of Narrative. Narrative\u2019s broad range of scholarship includes the English, American, and European novel, nonfiction narrative, film, and narrative as used in performance art.\u201d The Society\u2019s website is: http://narrative.georgetown.edu/ . Online access to articles is available through Project Muse (2002-present). Issues prior to 2002 are available through JSTOR. Storyworlds is a new, interdisciplinary journal of narrative theory. It features research on storytelling practices across a variety of media, including face-to-face interaction, literary writing, film and television, virtual environments, historiography, journalism, and graphic narratives, studied from perspectives developed in such fields as narratology, discourse analysis, jurisprudence, philosophy, cognitive and social psychology, Artificial Intelligence, medicine, and the study of organizations.\u201d Current journal contents and contact information are available at http://storyworlds.osu.edu . The journal is available on-line on Project Muse. In addition to these journals focused narrowly on narrative, there are journals that address narrative specifically but from a particular perspective. Obviously most, if not all, of the journals with which you are familiar in the fields of composition, folklore, or literary studies will include narrative as part of their purview, but you may also want to take a look at a few other journals that you, perhaps, would not normally encounter, such as Discourse Processes or Genre . Special Issues In Autumn 1980, Critical Inquiry 7(1) released a special issue entitled simply: On Narrative. (URL: http://www.jstor.org/stable/i257724 .)

For more on the corpus, see below .","title":"Texts"},{"location":"531/#requirements","text":"","title":"Requirements"},{"location":"531/#participation","text":"Seminar participants are expected to comport themselves as, well, as if they were in a seminar: A seminar is, generally, a form of academic instruction, either at an academic institution or offered by a commercial or professional organization. It has the function of bringing together small groups for recurring meetings, focusing each time on some particular subject, in which everyone present is requested to participate actively. This is often accomplished through an ongoing Socratic dialogue with a seminar leader or instructor, or through a more formal presentation of research. The idea behind the seminar system is to familiarize students more extensively with the methodology of their chosen subject and also to allow them to interact with examples of the practical problems that always occur during research work. It is essentially a place where assigned readings are discussed, questions can be raised and debates can be conducted. (Thank you, Wikipedia.) Participation includes a wide variety of forms: active listening, thoughtful speaking, short presentations, involvement in in-class and out-of-class individual and group assignments. Some of these may include, as seems fitting for a seminar led by a folklorist, the occasional exploration of the world beyond campus in the form of observations you make in places like book stores, coffee shops, and other places where people gather to talk or read/write. There is no set list of assignments in this regard: this is something that must arise out of a sense of the seminar as a particular historical group of individuals. (Again, you would expect no less an assertion from a folklorist.) In addition to the assumed active participation, which includes a number of projects and/or assignments as well as active listening and talking, this seminar also requires the preparation and presentation of a conference paper ( >= 2500 words) and a seminar paper ( >= 7500 words). The idea behind this particular arrangement is that the conference paper will be due before the seminar paper, giving participants an advanced deadline that makes it possible to test the viability of an idea and to have time to expand the paper into something of consequence that we call the seminar paper and we often imagine as leading to an article. That is, both the written assignments in this seminar are designed to match conventional scholarly outputs. (We will have more to discuss \u2013 e.g., how sometimes expanding a conference presentation is harder than shrinking a research paper or what to do when a project implodes at the presentation stage \u2013 during the course of the seminar.) (See the project description below for more information.) The weighting of grades will be as follows: participation in the seminar, which includes short in-seminar presentations and activities, makes up one half of a participant\u2019s evaluation. The conference paper and the seminar paper make up the other half. I hold out any weighting of the two for the following reason: it is entirely possible that the conference paper goes nowhere. If that is the case, first, good. Failure is one way to learn, and it is better to have a project blow up in the smaller form of the conference paper than to fall apart halfway through the seminar paper. Hence, should the conference paper go awry, it should matter less in any final evaluation. The same goes for the seminar paper. This is an educational setting: failure must be an option. (Not trying is not.)","title":"Participation"},{"location":"531/#corpus","text":"Because time is not infinite, each of you is constrained by a limit of 10,000 words: this can be one text or several. A further constraint is that we will need to balance our text between those items that are obviously or conventionally narrative and those which test boundaries.

That is not terrible timing for a seminar paper, but for attempting anything earlier, it does make things difficult. Based on past experience, I would like to propose that you begin with a research proposal with the following contents: a one-paragraph (200-500 words) statement of the texts in which you are interested and the theories or models through which you would like to explore them. This is only a preliminary sketch, nothing more. You are putting words down because getting words down is, first, always a good thing, and words beget words, also a good thing.

Narrative, however, is a relatively recent locus for organizing scholarly and scientific investigation. Prior to its development as a subject of study in the twentieth century, narrative was largely viewed through a lens of other objects \u2013 tragic plays, novels, myths. While a seminar of this nature could spend a considerable amount of time in the period prior to the formalist-structuralist articulation of narrative as an object in its own right, we are going to bounce around a bit, hoping, in some shadow of Bayes, to locate ourselves through apparent random pings in the great depths of intellectual history. We begin with two readings, one a narrative, and one a scholarly examination: McConnell, Richard. 1924. The Most Dangerous Game. Collier\u2019s . [Moodle]. For those interested in the sheer volume of adaptations of the story, the Wikipedia entry for the short story has a decent, if not complete (because impossible), list. Schiffrin, Deborah. 2009.

Literature as Equipment for Living. In The Philosophy of Literary Form , 293-304. University of California Press. [Moodle]. Finally, before we leap into our own exploration of the development of narrative studies, it won\u2019t hurt to read some surveys and develop some sense of the larger landscape. For this, there are two encyclopedias, one you know and one you are less likely to know. The first entry for \u201cNarratology\u201d is in Wikipedia , and the second in the Living Handbook of Narratology . The former is short; the latter long.","title":"A Bayesian Introduction to Narrative Studies"},{"location":"531/#unitizing-narrative-motifs-functions","text":"Before we examine Propp\u2019s work, it\u2019s important to understand the larger dialogue in which he is engaging. Specifically, early in Morphology , Propp notes that \u201cthe study of the tale has been pursued for the most part only genetically, and, to a great extent, without attempts at preliminary, systematic description\u201d (5). Genetic references the great philological collection projects of the nineteenth century that were, for the most part, focused on origins and originals. In the twentieth century, that focus would become what is now known as the historic-geographic method, and its most noted accomplishment are the great indices of folklore studies: the tale-type index and the motif index. The best way to understand them is to use them.

This seminar would be remiss if you did not read about the idea of motif from the compiler himself, Stith Thompson. I have also included Angela Maniak\u2019s short introduction to the role of the role of indexes, or indices, and bibliographies in classical forms of scholarship for those less acquainted with them.

Barthes\u2019 \u201cIntroduction to the Structural Analysis of Narratives\u201d first appeared in Communications 8 in 1966. (We are reading the translation published in NLH in 1975. Another translation (into English) can be found in Image Music Text , published in 1977.) Communications was a pathbreaking French journal, and this issue featured essays by Greimas, Bremond, Metz, Todorov, and Genette, all of whom were well on their way to becoming some of the more important figures in structuralism and/or narrative studies. They are typically grouped together for their combined debts to a variety of sources which are easily confused for readers otherwise unfamiliar with the broader intellectual history of the twentieth century. Greimas et al. drew upon structural linguistics (as articulated by Saussure and Benveniste), the Prague School (most notably the work of Roman Jakobson), Russian formalism (particularly Propp but also Bakhtin, Medvedev, among others), structural anthropology (as advanced by Claude Levi-Strauss but also found in the work of Mauss).

The Journal of Narrative Theory appears to be the oldest journal focused specifically on narrative. Founded in 1971 as the Journal of Narrative Technique , JNT \u201chas provided a forum for the theoretical exploration of narrative in all its forms. Building on this foundation, JNT publishes essays addressing the epistemological, global, historical, formal, and political dimensions of narrative from a variety of methodological and theoretical perspectives.\u201d JNT is available on-line through Project Muse. Narrative is \u201cthe official journal of the International Society for the Study of Narrative. Narrative\u2019s broad range of scholarship includes the English, American, and European novel, nonfiction narrative, film, and narrative as used in performance art.\u201d The Society\u2019s website is: http://narrative.georgetown.edu/ . Online access to articles is available through Project Muse (2002-present). Issues prior to 2002 are available through JSTOR. Storyworlds is a new, interdisciplinary journal of narrative theory. It features research on storytelling practices across a variety of media, including face-to-face interaction, literary writing, film and television, virtual environments, historiography, journalism, and graphic narratives, studied from perspectives developed in such fields as narratology, discourse analysis, jurisprudence, philosophy, cognitive and social psychology, Artificial Intelligence, medicine, and the study of organizations.\u201d Current journal contents and contact information are available at http://storyworlds.osu.edu . The journal is available on-line on Project Muse. In addition to these journals focused narrowly on narrative, there are journals that address narrative specifically but from a particular perspective. Obviously most, if not all, of the journals with which you are familiar in the fields of composition, folklore, or literary studies will include narrative as part of their purview, but you may also want to take a look at a few other journals that you, perhaps, would not normally encounter, such as Discourse Processes or Genre .","title":"Journals"},{"location":"531/#special-issues","text":"In Autumn 1980, Critical Inquiry 7(1) released a special issue entitled simply: On Narrative.

John Laudun HLG 356, MW 9:30-10:30, 14:30-15:30, and Tuesday mornings by appointment. laudun@louisiana.edu Course Description This course is a survey of key concepts, problems, and perspectives in folklore theory and method, focusing on key moments, ideas, and texts in the evolution of folklore studies in order to acquire a \u201cfeel\u201d for the foundations of the discipline. For the purposes of this course, the field is conceived fairly broadly and includes work done in adjacent fields like anthropology, sociology, psychology, linguistics, and literary studies. As much as it is possible, the readings are chronological, allowing us to follow the interactive dimensions of intellectual history, wherein one theory arises as a response to (extension of, corrective of, or refutation of) another theory. Mileage in such a chronology must vary, however, as some texts (usually those that awaited translation) are considered in the context of those texts they most influenced. The purpose of any proseminar is to acquaint students with the core texts or theories of a particular field of inquiry. Folklore\u2019s diverse beginnings and many interrelations make it particularly difficult to gather all such materials into a semester of study. The aim of this course, then, is to familiarize you with those texts, thinkers, and ideas that seem central in light of recent developments in the discipline and to acquaint you with other texts, thinkers, and ideas so that you may begin to see these complex webs for yourself. A proseminar assumes you have an interest in a field or discipline as a profession, not necessarily as a professional practicing within the field, but as someone interested in the history and nature of the practices of the field as it has developed over time and through various institutions. We will, then, spend the semester reading from folklore\u2019s intellectual history and discussing the implications (those) ideas have for our understanding and uses of folklore. Speaking of the field, we will not in this course address directly, in the sense of how-to, the topic of fieldwork, though we will on a regular occasion be concerned with methodology as it is implicated in various theories. That does not lessen the importance of fieldwork, and I encourage, but do not require, all those trying to understand the discipline of folklore studies to do some kind of fieldwork. Extended fieldwork, in the sense of lasting beyond the first interview, is an experience that no one with an investment in the discipline should be without. A more extensive treatment of fieldwork theories and methods is to be found in the folklore fieldwork course. Finally, there are some methods and skills which any competent \u201cknowledge worker\u201d \u2014 more on the use of this term during the semester \u2014 should have in this day and age. Some of them have long been within the purview of folklore studies Specifically, folklorists have always, in some ways, engaged the collection and sorting of data that today\u2019s databases make, in many ways, trivial. We will talk about this and other matters throughout the semester, but you should also feel free to bring such topics and concerns up as part of our ongoing conversation. The goal of this course is to familiarize you with an intellectual history, and in some ways landscape, of a particular discipline, folklore studies, in order for you to begin to map out where your own interests lie. I hope that the materials we cover, and their attendant bibliographies and references, will begin to suggest possibilities for you, but there are always more books and journals than can be scribbled down here. Your real job is to go out and find that territory which interests you. Course Requirements In addition to the obvious requirement that everyone come to class with the reading done, with at least two to three questions or comments prepared, and the willingness to engage in a discussion, seminar participants are, this semester, required to write a literature review on a topic, or topics, of her choosing as well as leading a seminar or sequence of seminars on a topic. (All such topics are to be established in dialogue with the instructor.) Participation A full quarter of your grade is based on that ever-slippery notion of \u201cparticipation.\u201d I leave it up to you to concretize it in a way that manifests the sublimity of your wit, the substance of your thought, and the grace of your presence. Nota bene: I take participation very seriously in all my classes, but most especially in seminars. (45%) Presentation(s) This is a seminar. Everyone is responsible for its success, not just the instructor. As a seminar participant, each of you will be responsible for leading the class at various moments throughout the semester. Each presentation will be based on a different infrastructure: an abstract, an outline, a series of slides with text, a series of slides with only graphics, etc. (15%) In the past, I have encouraged or required participants to profile a journal or to review a book. The description of those assignments is included here for your information: it should be noted that writing a book review is an easy way to get published, and it was once seen as part of the overall functioning of a scholarly domain. Journal Profile In parallel with books, the record of any discipline is to be found in its journals. They are also the places where young scholars have their best opportunity to see their ideas in print. I encourage all graduate students to join their respective disciplinary organizations, especially while student rates apply, but I also require that participants in this seminar acquaint themselves with the journals available to them as resources and outlets for their work. Book Review You will write one book review, following the JAF format, on a text of your choosing. Please see me if you are having any difficulty in deciding upon a book. (Book reviews are also a great way to get published.) Both the reviews and the profiles above will be compiled into a seminar publication. Literature Review Because of the nature of this course, I forego the most familiar of all course assignment genres, the seminar paper, and instead ask you to imagine a project, of a size and scope to be decided, and to sketch out what resources you will need. (See this guide to lit reviews for a basic template.) (40%) Course Agenda Early History In the first unit of this course, we will examine the emergence of two ideas that are still very powerful in our time: the Enlightenment\u2019s privileging of rationality and the counter-Enlightenment\u2019s attempt to recover humanity through nationalism. Both were an attempt to reveal, and/or encourage, common cultural underpinnings to states ruled separately. These two logics, rationalism and nationalism, so govern our thinking that we cannot, at times, comprehend the complexities of history \u2013 i.e., that history itself is a cynical arrangement of dynasties perfecting the technologies of domination that reached its nadir in the brutality of the colonial era, an era in which we still abide. What we will be tracking is a slow shift in focus: From the origins of ideas and forms; Through the development and spread of ideas and forms, at first in cultural evolution and later in history; To the uses of these ideas and forms. Throughout this history, we will retain texts as our primary object for understanding human nature. The questions we need to remind ourselves to ask are: What is history\u2019s relationship to our object of study throughout these transformations? What new questions have arisen? What do texts do? Why texts? It is important to remember that these changes within the narrow domain of how we imagine human discursive productivity are really part of a larger collection of histories, some intellectual and some political. Nineteenth century interest in folklore was, to some degree, spurred by concerns over (1) industrialization and the social changes being wrought by it and (2) the political and cultural domination of one nation by another: of Germany by France; Ireland by Britain; Finland by Russia. One German intellectual in particular, J.G. Herder, urged German poets and composers to turn to the traditions of the peasants, whose traditional tales and songs preserved the authentic national spirit, identity, values of the German people. These were, Herder argued, the proper basis, the raw materials, for elite literature and music. The Brothers Grimm were among those whom Herder inspired. But the Grimms were not interested in the tellers, or the role tale-telling played among the peasants who perpetuated the tradition. They looked upon the tales they collected as declined myth, and were interested only in the texts and what they thought it told them about earlier, purer, forms of German culture. Others began collecting folklore in other countries for similar reasons. In this vein, William Thoms coined the term \u201cfolk-lore\u201d in 1846. Thoms interest was \u201cpopular antiquities\u201d but he preferred a \u201cgood Anglo-Saxon word\u201d for it. Like the Grimms, Thoms regarded folklore as a survival from an earlier time, a vestige of an earlier stage of development in human society and culture, with no function or relevance today, and no contemporary meaning. The Grimms, and most of those they inspired, virtually ignored the actual life of the lore. Fieldwork standards at that time were very loose: collection, not ethnography. There was no idea of adhering to the spoken language of tale-tellers, of valuing the stories as actually told, of trying to observe actual storytelling events. Rather, the standard practice was to rewrite texts, to \u201cimprove\u201d them for a literate readership. For those less familiar with European history in general and European intellectual history in particular, Christof Koch\u2019s review of George Makari\u2019s Soul Machine: The Invention of the Modern Mind is a thumbnail sketch of the developments in Western European philosophy that led up to our current moment of understanding human consciousness in the particular way we do: Koch, Christof. 2016. Constructing the Modern Mind. Scientific American Mind 27 (3): 22-27. DOI: 10.1038/scientificamericanmind0516-22. URL . Koch\u2019s sketch leads us right into Bauman and Briggs\u2019 Voices of Modernity . Here are a few other readings to get your started: Why western liberals have long picked the wrong historical hero Different Tongue, Same Information: 17-language Study Reveals How We Communicate Information at a Similar Rate Michel Foucault: An In-depth Explanation in Clear Language is a brief and easy to understand explanation of the thought of Michel Foucault, one of the most cited figures in the humanities and social sciences.

DOI: 10.2307/1500095. And just in case you were curious about the larger historical trends that were occurring that might be driving some of these ideas, you might want to make sure you understand how the pulses of the Little Ice Age (1250-1850) affected Europe\u2019s populations as well as how the enclosures that started in the 1200s but began to be implemented more seriously, especially in England, from 1700 to 1820 played out. The Emergence of the American Folklore Society The Grimms\u2019 Haus und kindermarchen was an international bestseller, prompting scholars around Europe to fulfill the charter set out by Jakob Grimm to discover the kernel of a given nation/culture\u2014the two now being firmly intertwined. There is considerable work in England that co-occurs with the early nineteenth century of Schoolcraft, and it is worth mentioning here the importance of Edward Tylor, Andrew Lang, Gomme, profiled by Richard Dorson in Peasant Customs and Savage Myths: Selections from the British Folklorists (1968) and in British Folklorists: A History (1969), in developing the notion not only of culture amongst European nations but also working out an evolutionary schema, as that idea became available and popular, for culture itself.

After reading these first two, literally, seminal essays in the first issue of the Journal, scan the table of contents and at least read the first few pages, if not skim in their entirety, the contributions from Newell on voodoo in Haiti, of Bolton on counting-out rhymes of children, and Brinton\u2019s \u201cLen\u00e2p\u00e9 Conversations\u201d before reading Boas\u2019s \u201cOn Certain Songs and Dances of the Kwakiutl of British Columbia\u201d more carefully. Before you put away the volume, be sure to take a look at the \u201cWaste-Basket of Words\u201d and the first entry under Note and Queries. Later, Boas would offer a more synthetic account of the many things he and his students were encountering: Boas, Franz. 1904. Some Traits of Primitive Culture. Journal of American Folklore 17/67: 243-254. In the same volume, you will find this catalog: 1904. Record of Negro Folk-Lore. Journal of American Folklore 17/67: 296-297. It helps, I think, to follow how the field consolidated its practices (in terms of genre) over the next few decades on various kinds of collections, some of which came with ethnographic notes and some of which did not, balanced by the occasional ethnographic sketch. Take a look at the Volume Information for JAF 30 (1917) and then read from that volume: Parsons, Elsie Clews. 1917. All Souls Day. Journal of American Folklore 30/118: 495-496. By the end of the nineteenth century, collections were the established principle practice of folklore studies. As the twentieth century unfolded, however, Franz Boas in the U.S. And Bronislaw Malinowski in the U.K. Became increasingly interested in ethnography. The result was something of a split between the practices of literary folklorists, focused on texts only, and anthropological folklorists, who focused on larger socio-cultural practices which were understood as the context for texts. With that as a backdrop, Hurston\u2019s Mules and Men (1935) reveals itself to be quite an innovative text. But reading widely in the Journal during this period of the Society really helps to establish what folklore scholarship, and thus the humanities and anthropology, looked like during this period. The Fifties: The Moment before \u201cthe Turn\u201d The great collections of language use proved a fertile ground for a variety of structuralist approaches. The first form to be introduced to American folklorists was the structuralism of Claude Levi-Strauss, which, based on hundreds of indigenous American texts, fit well with the established practice of text-oriented scholars, many of whom remain focused on the grand typological/indexical projects begun by Aanti Aarne and elaborated by Stith Thompson. The tensions of the fifties would help feed the felt need for, and thus possible resolution offered by, the ethnography of speaking which emerged in the early sixties. That was but one resolution; there were a number of unresolved issues that remain to this day. Mead, Margaret. 1951. Anthropologist and Historian: Their Common Problems.

(E.g., William Barrett\u2019s The Irrational Man [1958] \u2014 see note below). A consideration of these broader trends would reveal that the acceptance of work by Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Albert Camus following the second World War was anticipated by work in American philosophy, such as John Dewey\u2019s Art as Experience (1934) and Kenneth Burke\u2019s Philosophy of Literary Form (1941). of Some of the effort to discern a particular American culture was in response to the rise of rich international connections, many of which were brought about by displaced intellectuals who came to the U.S. in the thirties and forties. Some of them stayed and the result was that American intellectuals interested in work by Roman Jakobson found him referring to work by Vladimir Propp and Mikhail Bakhtin, and so American scholars found themselves confronted by an entire school of literary theory, now known as Russian formalism, which interacted somewhat with their emerging interest in structuralism as it had been developed in France by L\u00e9vi-Strauss, Piaget, Lacan, and others.

The Turn towards Performance Dell Hymes proposed the \u201cethnography of speaking\u201d as a term to address the importance of performance, over and against the focus on competence in linguistics, in the early sixties. As the decade wore on, and the social sciences began to focus more on The Social Construction of Reality (Peter Berger, 1968), folklorists were part of the larger re-thinking of how people, both individually and in groups, theorized and acted upon the world as they understood it. While we start with Bauman\u2019s programmatic essay, \u201cVerbal Art as Performance,\u201d his earlier essays (some of which we read and some of which we do not) reveal that he is working through a number of dimensions of a rhetoric of folklore forms alongside others.

For the purposes of this course, the field is conceived fairly broadly and includes work done in adjacent fields like anthropology, sociology, psychology, linguistics, and literary studies. As much as it is possible, the readings are chronological, allowing us to follow the interactive dimensions of intellectual history, wherein one theory arises as a response to (extension of, corrective of, or refutation of) another theory. Mileage in such a chronology must vary, however, as some texts (usually those that awaited translation) are considered in the context of those texts they most influenced. The purpose of any proseminar is to acquaint students with the core texts or theories of a particular field of inquiry. Folklore\u2019s diverse beginnings and many interrelations make it particularly difficult to gather all such materials into a semester of study. The aim of this course, then, is to familiarize you with those texts, thinkers, and ideas that seem central in light of recent developments in the discipline and to acquaint you with other texts, thinkers, and ideas so that you may begin to see these complex webs for yourself. A proseminar assumes you have an interest in a field or discipline as a profession, not necessarily as a professional practicing within the field, but as someone interested in the history and nature of the practices of the field as it has developed over time and through various institutions. We will, then, spend the semester reading from folklore\u2019s intellectual history and discussing the implications (those) ideas have for our understanding and uses of folklore. Speaking of the field, we will not in this course address directly, in the sense of how-to, the topic of fieldwork, though we will on a regular occasion be concerned with methodology as it is implicated in various theories. That does not lessen the importance of fieldwork, and I encourage, but do not require, all those trying to understand the discipline of folklore studies to do some kind of fieldwork. Extended fieldwork, in the sense of lasting beyond the first interview, is an experience that no one with an investment in the discipline should be without. A more extensive treatment of fieldwork theories and methods is to be found in the folklore fieldwork course. Finally, there are some methods and skills which any competent \u201cknowledge worker\u201d \u2014 more on the use of this term during the semester \u2014 should have in this day and age. Some of them have long been within the purview of folklore studies Specifically, folklorists have always, in some ways, engaged the collection and sorting of data that today\u2019s databases make, in many ways, trivial. We will talk about this and other matters throughout the semester, but you should also feel free to bring such topics and concerns up as part of our ongoing conversation. The goal of this course is to familiarize you with an intellectual history, and in some ways landscape, of a particular discipline, folklore studies, in order for you to begin to map out where your own interests lie. I hope that the materials we cover, and their attendant bibliographies and references, will begin to suggest possibilities for you, but there are always more books and journals than can be scribbled down here. Your real job is to go out and find that territory which interests you.","title":"Course Description"},{"location":"632/#course-requirements","text":"In addition to the obvious requirement that everyone come to class with the reading done, with at least two to three questions or comments prepared, and the willingness to engage in a discussion, seminar participants are, this semester, required to write a literature review on a topic, or topics, of her choosing as well as leading a seminar or sequence of seminars on a topic.

Both were an attempt to reveal, and/or encourage, common cultural underpinnings to states ruled separately. These two logics, rationalism and nationalism, so govern our thinking that we cannot, at times, comprehend the complexities of history \u2013 i.e., that history itself is a cynical arrangement of dynasties perfecting the technologies of domination that reached its nadir in the brutality of the colonial era, an era in which we still abide. What we will be tracking is a slow shift in focus: From the origins of ideas and forms; Through the development and spread of ideas and forms, at first in cultural evolution and later in history; To the uses of these ideas and forms. Throughout this history, we will retain texts as our primary object for understanding human nature. The questions we need to remind ourselves to ask are: What is history\u2019s relationship to our object of study throughout these transformations? What new questions have arisen? What do texts do? Why texts? It is important to remember that these changes within the narrow domain of how we imagine human discursive productivity are really part of a larger collection of histories, some intellectual and some political. Nineteenth century interest in folklore was, to some degree, spurred by concerns over (1) industrialization and the social changes being wrought by it and (2) the political and cultural domination of one nation by another: of Germany by France; Ireland by Britain; Finland by Russia. One German intellectual in particular, J.G. Herder, urged German poets and composers to turn to the traditions of the peasants, whose traditional tales and songs preserved the authentic national spirit, identity, values of the German people. These were, Herder argued, the proper basis, the raw materials, for elite literature and music. The Brothers Grimm were among those whom Herder inspired. But the Grimms were not interested in the tellers, or the role tale-telling played among the peasants who perpetuated the tradition. They looked upon the tales they collected as declined myth, and were interested only in the texts and what they thought it told them about earlier, purer, forms of German culture. Others began collecting folklore in other countries for similar reasons. In this vein, William Thoms coined the term \u201cfolk-lore\u201d in 1846. Thoms interest was \u201cpopular antiquities\u201d but he preferred a \u201cgood Anglo-Saxon word\u201d for it. Like the Grimms, Thoms regarded folklore as a survival from an earlier time, a vestige of an earlier stage of development in human society and culture, with no function or relevance today, and no contemporary meaning. The Grimms, and most of those they inspired, virtually ignored the actual life of the lore. Fieldwork standards at that time were very loose: collection, not ethnography. There was no idea of adhering to the spoken language of tale-tellers, of valuing the stories as actually told, of trying to observe actual storytelling events. Rather, the standard practice was to rewrite texts, to \u201cimprove\u201d them for a literate readership. For those less familiar with European history in general and European intellectual history in particular, Christof Koch\u2019s review of George Makari\u2019s Soul Machine: The Invention of the Modern Mind is a thumbnail sketch of the developments in Western European philosophy that led up to our current moment of understanding human consciousness in the particular way we do: Koch, Christof. 2016.

And just in case you were curious about the larger historical trends that were occurring that might be driving some of these ideas, you might want to make sure you understand how the pulses of the Little Ice Age (1250-1850) affected Europe\u2019s populations as well as how the enclosures that started in the 1200s but began to be implemented more seriously, especially in England, from 1700 to 1820 played out.","title":"Early History"},{"location":"632/#the-emergence-of-the-american-folklore-society","text":"The Grimms\u2019 Haus und kindermarchen was an international bestseller, prompting scholars around Europe to fulfill the charter set out by Jakob Grimm to discover the kernel of a given nation/culture\u2014the two now being firmly intertwined.

It helps, I think, to follow how the field consolidated its practices (in terms of genre) over the next few decades on various kinds of collections, some of which came with ethnographic notes and some of which did not, balanced by the occasional ethnographic sketch. Take a look at the Volume Information for JAF 30 (1917) and then read from that volume: Parsons, Elsie Clews. 1917. All Souls Day. Journal of American Folklore 30/118: 495-496. By the end of the nineteenth century, collections were the established principle practice of folklore studies. As the twentieth century unfolded, however, Franz Boas in the U.S. And Bronislaw Malinowski in the U.K. Became increasingly interested in ethnography. The result was something of a split between the practices of literary folklorists, focused on texts only, and anthropological folklorists, who focused on larger socio-cultural practices which were understood as the context for texts. With that as a backdrop, Hurston\u2019s Mules and Men (1935) reveals itself to be quite an innovative text. But reading widely in the Journal during this period of the Society really helps to establish what folklore scholarship, and thus the humanities and anthropology, looked like during this period.","title":"The Tale-Type &amp; Motif Indices"},{"location":"632/#the-fifties-the-moment-before-the-turn","text":"The great collections of language use proved a fertile ground for a variety of structuralist approaches.

A consideration of these broader trends would reveal that the acceptance of work by Martin Heidegger, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Albert Camus following the second World War was anticipated by work in American philosophy, such as John Dewey\u2019s Art as Experience (1934) and Kenneth Burke\u2019s Philosophy of Literary Form (1941). of Some of the effort to discern a particular American culture was in response to the rise of rich international connections, many of which were brought about by displaced intellectuals who came to the U.S. in the thirties and forties. Some of them stayed and the result was that American intellectuals interested in work by Roman Jakobson found him referring to work by Vladimir Propp and Mikhail Bakhtin, and so American scholars found themselves confronted by an entire school of literary theory, now known as Russian formalism, which interacted somewhat with their emerging interest in structuralism as it had been developed in France by L\u00e9vi-Strauss, Piaget, Lacan, and others.

While a great deal can be gleaned from a variety of bounded events and actions\u2013for example, by limiting the possible responses to a question, much more can be learned when we allow humans to produce the texts they wish to produce and then we as analysts set about finding better ways to understand them. This course is designed to familiarize students with text analytics, from text processing to vector semantics. The course assumes that participants have a familiarity with the fundamental features of Python, the programming language we will be using to examine natural language. To be clear, most of our examples will be drawn from English, but some of our discussion will be focused on what it means to work across languages. We will also give some consideration to how a focus on English has shaped the development of NLP, which in turn has shaped what the functionality of many NLP operations available in Python and other programming languages. The course sequence begins with a quick review of Python and basic text processing operations. From there we spend time with regular expressions, parsers, and state machines. After that, we take up the necessity of collecting data and then working with our data set to answer questions that arise from the data itself. As participants work through the course, they will be expected to: understand the basics of string operations and text processing in Python build upon those basics to develop approaches to text processing We will use a variety of data sets throughout the course, and it is expected that those data sets, also known as corpora in some instances, will act as models/examples for you to build your own. Requirements We will read broadly from corpus linguistics, corpus stylistics, and information and data science essays and texts. Successful participation requires that you keep up with the reading. In addition to participation, this course also requires a number of exams as well as a course project which consists of a portfolio of pieces which you will assemble across the span of the course: a curated data set, a set of useful algorithms that process the texts, 3 visualizations of the material, and a short paper of 2000 words that describes a facet of the data set and your exploration. Schedule Text Basics The \u201cThe Zipf Mystery\u201d . Python Basics In the initial module of the course, we take up the basics of a language like Python, with an eye to identifying essential techniques and patterns and being familiar with and using the standard modules . Computing with strings to everything else that occurs later in the course, and we must make sure that we understanding the relationships between decision structures , loop structures , and Booleans in relationship to strings. In regards to strings, we introduce concerns about tokens and types in order to introduce questions about parsing . Basic String Operations There is always the temptation to use \u201cthe shiny,\u201d whatever that is in a current moment, but everything shiny was built on top of the standard modules, and it\u2019s always a good idea to ask if you can accomplish a given task or goal using simpler techniques, both because you control what happens but also because you understand what happens. This unit focuses common problems in text processing that can be solved rather readily using techniques we discuss. With these basic recipes in hand, and the mindset to produce them, you should be able to adapt them to more complex problems. Regular Expressions If regular expressions were easy, there would not be so many books and sites dedicated to explaining them or making it easy to develop regex without actually understanding it. This short unit explains the essentials of regex, with a lot of examples of different kinds of problems, e.g. lookaheads, on which to work. The goal is to have a place to begin asking the right questions, not necessarily always to have the right answer. A Short History and Explanation of GREP . Parsers & State Machines So far in this course we have dealt with strings as flat texts\u2014that is, as if everything within them lies at the same formal or semantic level. Anyone who has ever struggled with a sentence diagram knows that is not the case when it comes to even simple strings like sentences, let along more complex ones.

While a great deal can be gleaned from a variety of bounded events and actions\u2013for example, by limiting the possible responses to a question, much more can be learned when we allow humans to produce the texts they wish to produce and then we as analysts set about finding better ways to understand them. This course is designed to familiarize students with text analytics, from text processing to vector semantics. The course assumes that participants have a familiarity with the fundamental features of Python, the programming language we will be using to examine natural language. To be clear, most of our examples will be drawn from English, but some of our discussion will be focused on what it means to work across languages. We will also give some consideration to how a focus on English has shaped the development of NLP, which in turn has shaped what the functionality of many NLP operations available in Python and other programming languages. The course sequence begins with a quick review of Python and basic text processing operations. From there we spend time with regular expressions, parsers, and state machines. After that, we take up the necessity of collecting data and then working with our data set to answer questions that arise from the data itself. As participants work through the course, they will be expected to: understand the basics of string operations and text processing in Python build upon those basics to develop approaches to text processing We will use a variety of data sets throughout the course, and it is expected that those data sets, also known as corpora in some instances, will act as models/examples for you to build your own.","title":"Course Design &amp; Goals"},{"location":"c200-textanayltics/#requirements","text":"We will read broadly from corpus linguistics, corpus stylistics, and information and data science essays and texts.

A fundamental question across a range of disciplines is how such dynamics are shaped by the structure of the networks on which they occur. Of particular interest is viral spreading, where content\u2013whether it be an orally transmitted rumor or a digitally transmitted text, image, or video\u2013sweeps through a population by being frequently shared between individuals, leading to widespread adoption. In this course we will examine such cascades, including whether the likelihood, size, and speed of such cascades depends as much on the nodes through which they pass (people) as the topology of the network as well as what material is passing (texts) through the nodes to instantiate the cascade. This course offers a survey of perspectives on the spread of ideas through networks, with a principal focus on online networks. The principle behind that choice is that the latter not only amplify the spread of ideas but also offer more readily available data collection: the goal of the course is for participants to track a cascade of their own choosing, attempting to determine the topology of its course and the nature of the network which it reveals and, at the same time, instantiates. The goal of this course is to understand how information spreads through networks: we will focus on accurate description with some exploration of possibilities for prescription \u2013certainly the market of being able to guarantee something going viral is quite large, and while this course is not that kind of course, one of the arenas we will chart are these imagined paths to popularity, fame, and fortune. Texts Most of our texts are drawn from scholarly and scientific journals or well-established periodicals that cover our topic among others. Berger, Jonah. 2016. Contagious . Simon and Schuster. Requirements In addition to the required texts listed in the agenda below, participants are expected to be comfortable with Python and have a working installation on their computer. Because assignments for this course are hosted on GitHub for Education, participants will need to have a working knowledge of Git and have a GitHub account. Mastery of the materials and methods for this course is assessed along the following lines: Participation (20%) requires active engagement with the course materials through discussions and in-class activities, some of which will, I hope, be reasonably fun and also demonstrative in terms of information flows . Exams (30%). There are three of them. They come at the expected intervals and are entirely about insuring that you have mastered the contents of the material and can apply it to the examples provided in the exams. Collection (20%). Getting data is work; getting good data is hard work. But data is so important that we set aside time in the course, and reward work on it accordingly. Project (30%). The course project is not a monolithic essay\u2013though it can be if you decide that\u2019s really what you want to do. Instead, it is a portfolio, in which, yes, writing does feature, but also a (well commented) code base, a variety of outputs (including Jupiter notebook pages), and various visualizations (or auralizations or 3D realizations). The contents are ultimately up to each participant and are negotiated with the course instructor (me). Agenda Foundations We begin our course with a bit of an excursion: we travel back in time to understand how the printing press changed the very way we think about facts and ideas and even the way we think those things get distributed and, just as importantly, authenticated. An episode from a rather dated BBC series, The Day the Universe Changed , does a rather good job of putting us inside the mind of a medieval person, and then demonstrating how print changed, well, everything. We watch the fourth episode, \u201cA Matter of Fact.\u201d Then we examine how texts work\u2013because if we consider them only to be referential, then we have entirely missed how they work. As we will explore: texts give us the power to name situations or to transact social identity. Burke, Kenneth. 1941. Literature as Equipment for Living. In The Philosophy of Literary Form , 293-304.

The Transform Our current era is often called the digital era, and while it is, it is not the case that it was unprecedented or unheralded. After the oral-to-print transition, many societies, and their various cultures, underwent a media transition. Like print before it, media was produced by the few to distribute to the many. It did not, however, demand an additional competence like literacy. Instead, audio media like radio and records and video media like, first, film, and then later television, were in many ways consumable without any further training. While we should never assume that any representation is like real life, these media were, and are, fairly good at obscuring such boundaries, and how they do so is worth our attention.

JSTOR . Contents How something cascades through a network is determined both by the individuals involved as well the material cascading through it. A lot of the material we will consider has a somewhat older name, folklore. Folklorist Lynne McNeill explains why Folklore doesn\u2019t meme what you think it memes in this TEDxUSU talk. A good deal of the work done by folklorists in this regard has focused on legends. The famed Funk & Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology, and Legend had the following to say about legend in 1949: Originally something to be read at religious service or at meals, usually a saint\u2019s or martyr\u2019s life\u2013thus the Golden Legend of Jacobus de Voragine, a collection of saints\u2019 lives. Legend has since come to be used for a narrative supposedly based on fact, with an inter-mixture of traditional materials told about a person, place, or incident. The line between myth and legend is often vague; the myth has as its principal actors the gods, and its purpose explanation. Thus the Hercules stories may be considered to some extent myth (he is semi-divine, he made the Pillars of Hercules, etc.) or as legend (Hercules was a lord living at Tiryns). The legend is told as true; the myth\u2019s veracity is based on the belief of its hearers in the gods who are its characters. Compare local legend . (612) Dorst, John. 1990.

A fundamental question across a range of disciplines is how such dynamics are shaped by the structure of the networks on which they occur. Of particular interest is viral spreading, where content\u2013whether it be an orally transmitted rumor or a digitally transmitted text, image, or video\u2013sweeps through a population by being frequently shared between individuals, leading to widespread adoption. In this course we will examine such cascades, including whether the likelihood, size, and speed of such cascades depends as much on the nodes through which they pass (people) as the topology of the network as well as what material is passing (texts) through the nodes to instantiate the cascade. This course offers a survey of perspectives on the spread of ideas through networks, with a principal focus on online networks. The principle behind that choice is that the latter not only amplify the spread of ideas but also offer more readily available data collection: the goal of the course is for participants to track a cascade of their own choosing, attempting to determine the topology of its course and the nature of the network which it reveals and, at the same time, instantiates. The goal of this course is to understand how information spreads through networks: we will focus on accurate description with some exploration of possibilities for prescription \u2013certainly the market of being able to guarantee something going viral is quite large, and while this course is not that kind of course, one of the arenas we will chart are these imagined paths to popularity, fame, and fortune.","title":"Description, Design, Goals"},{"location":"c400-infospread/#texts","text":"Most of our texts are drawn from scholarly and scientific journals or well-established periodicals that cover our topic among others.

After the oral-to-print transition, many societies, and their various cultures, underwent a media transition. Like print before it, media was produced by the few to distribute to the many. It did not, however, demand an additional competence like literacy. Instead, audio media like radio and records and video media like, first, film, and then later television, were in many ways consumable without any further training. While we should never assume that any representation is like real life, these media were, and are, fairly good at obscuring such boundaries, and how they do so is worth our attention.

A lot of the material we will consider has a somewhat older name, folklore. Folklorist Lynne McNeill explains why Folklore doesn\u2019t meme what you think it memes in this TEDxUSU talk. A good deal of the work done by folklorists in this regard has focused on legends. The famed Funk & Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology, and Legend had the following to say about legend in 1949: Originally something to be read at religious service or at meals, usually a saint\u2019s or martyr\u2019s life\u2013thus the Golden Legend of Jacobus de Voragine, a collection of saints\u2019 lives. Legend has since come to be used for a narrative supposedly based on fact, with an inter-mixture of traditional materials told about a person, place, or incident. The line between myth and legend is often vague; the myth has as its principal actors the gods, and its purpose explanation. Thus the Hercules stories may be considered to some extent myth (he is semi-divine, he made the Pillars of Hercules, etc.) or as legend (Hercules was a lord living at Tiryns). The legend is told as true; the myth\u2019s veracity is based on the belief of its hearers in the gods who are its characters. Compare local legend . (612) Dorst, John. 1990.

This course encourages students to take a closer look for themselves not only at the folklore that surrounds and shapes each of us but also at the various ways it has been and is currently being represented. Taking a closer look requires participants to go out and see for themselves, engaging in field research in order to observe, document, and analyze folk culture as they experience and know it. While our chief focus will be verbal culture, we will explore other forms. Objectives Participants in this course will learn how to read scholarly and scientific definitions and analyses of human nature with a special emphasis on folk culture in general and narrative in particular and then apply those definitions or reproduce such analyses in their own thinking and writing. Writing is a significant component of any communication, be it scientific or professional, and participants in this course will be required to assume those voices necessary to accomplishing a particular task. In addition, as a course in folklore studies participants will also create documentation containing both metadata and data in appropriate markup, which may or may not include things like XML. Texts & Materials Required In addition to the book below, we will be reading a lot of articles available either through JSTOR, Project Muse, or through the course\u2019s Moodle website. All will be in PDF form, so please make sure you understand how to access and have also set aside money to print these materials.

Requirements To meet the course objectives enumerated above, students must attend both in-class lectures and discussions, keep up with the readings, and engage in a semester-long research project of their own devising and execution. Thus, this course is best enjoyed when taken by independent, self-motivated learners. In addition, this course also requires a reasonable level of emotional maturity, since folklore is \u201cequipment for living\u201d and materials we examine and discuss come from life itself, where things can be inflammatory or embarrassing. Participants must be prepared for this. No, really: if you are easily offended, then this course may not be for you. Assignments PARTICIPATION & QUIZZES (20%). Regular participation means being in class (on time), prepared, and participating actively both through listening and through talking. No more than three absences will be excused without consent of the instructor. As noted above, the chief delivery vehicle for information in this course is in class.[^1] From time to time, to check for comprehension and currency, I give in-class quizzes, which are folded into your participation grade. Unlike the exams, which are scheduled in advance and can also be made up, quizzes are one-time-only affairs. Part of the participation and quiz grade are small assignments, like the one where you collect a single story early in the semester. Like the grades on quizzes, a check mark means you got credit. EXAMS (30%). There are two exams in this course, which cover materials from lectures, discussions, readings, and viewings. The purpose of the exams is for you to demonstrate to me and to yourself your knowledge and comprehension of the theoretical and historical material presented in class. PROJECT (50%). This course has at its core an individual research project which you propose, plan, develop, draft, and submit over the course of the semester. The final submission includes a paper of 2500 words of polished prose and the appropriate documentation, and recordings, for the material analyzed in the paper.

Matters of \u201cFact\u201d As Wikipedia notes: The Day the Universe Changed is a British documentary television series written and presented by science historian James Burke, originally broadcast on BBC1 in [Spring] 1985 by the BBC [and rebroadcast on PBS in Autumn 1986]. The series\u2019 primary focus is on the effect of advances in science and technology on western society in its philosophical aspects. The title comes from the philosophical idea that the universe essentially only exists as one perceives it through what one knows; therefore, if one changes one\u2019s perception of the universe with new knowledge, one has essentially changed the universe itself. To illustrate this concept, James Burke tells the various stories of important scientific discoveries and technological advances and how they fundamentally altered how western civilization perceives the world. The series runs in roughly chronological order, from around the beginning of the Middle Ages to the present. (Wikipedia also has a nice entry on the printing press .) Readings Bauman, Richard. 1972.

The series\u2019 primary focus is on the effect of advances in science and technology on western society in its philosophical aspects. The title comes from the philosophical idea that the universe essentially only exists as one perceives it through what one knows; therefore, if one changes one\u2019s perception of the universe with new knowledge, one has essentially changed the universe itself. To illustrate this concept, James Burke tells the various stories of important scientific discoveries and technological advances and how they fundamentally altered how western civilization perceives the world. The series runs in roughly chronological order, from around the beginning of the Middle Ages to the present.

Towards that end, each participant is responsible for contributing to the ongoing documentation of Louisiana folk culture. Each contribution must be focused on a particular form or practice possess the following dimensions: First, and foremost, it must be accessionable : you and the people whom you document must be willing to have the work done be a part of the public record. In the case of a great deal of material, this means it is publishable upon final submission. In the case of sensitive material, this may mean a delay in publication, waiting for the sensitivity to pass. This is something to negotiate between participants, the people they document, and the instructor. (It goes without saying that the work must also be verifiable by the instructor.) Second, the documentation must be consumable : if it a written text, it must be readable. If it is an audio work, it must be listenable. If it is a video work, it must be watchable. This means raw audio or video files with poor sound and bad lighting and no editing are not acceptable. Just as a text which is only a transcript or the description of an object is not acceptable. Which means, a contribution must be: Analytical and possess a point of view, making a clear case for why an object is not only interesting but also important in terms of understanding some aspect of Louisiana folklore. That means that anything that is the focus of a project must be: Traditional . While the world is filled with interesting people doing interesting things, and kooky people doing kooky things, folklore studies is not about the interesting nor the kooky: it is about the things we find so significant that we repeat them. Traditions can be, however, quite small. Families, even just nuclear families, can have sayings and stories that are an integral, or marginal, part of how they communicate with each other. But within any object, it is the temporal dimension that gives it depth. Specifications The project must be submitted both electronically and as a hard copy. Electronic copies may be documents created by Word or Pages or another word processor if submitted as RTF. Paper copies muct have one-inch margins, twelve-point serif type faces, single-sided, and high quality toner or ink. (Faded submissions will be rejected.) Documentation must be submitted electronically and audio files may be in MP3 or AIF format. (No WAV files, please.) Video files should be MP4. Logs should accompany recordings and can be in either Word, Pages, or PDF. The written document must be no less than 2500 words, of which 1000 words of transcription can be counted towards the total. That means 1500 words, or approximately 5 typed, double-spaced pages, must be your own description, analysis, and explanation of the material being treated. Transcriptions greater than 1000 words may be included, and, if done well, will certainly be factored into a project\u2019s evaluation. (So, yes, more is almost always better, but good more. More with good documentation and transcription and on topic, not random more.) Deadlines The final version of the project must be turned in during the last week of class, on a day specified by the instructor. Prior to that date, there will be a number of draft submission deadlines. Missed deadlines will be noted, and while no immediate penalty is assessed, no consideration will be granted to exceptional circumstances as later, or the final, deadlines occur. Guidelines There are a number of things to keep in mind when making field recordings, the most prominent of which is making the people with whom you work comfortable. Under the tight timeline of this course, this is most often family and friends for most participants, but it can also be workmates or other acquaintances \u2013 it is exceedingly hard to start an entirely new project from scratch and complete any documentation of note, let alone add any analysis within the scant few months of the semester. Additional dimensions of making someone comfortable is to record them in a environment with which they are familiar and under circumstances as close to the usual or the familiar as possible. When it comes time to record someone, make sure you have tested, and practiced with, your equipment. If you are using our phone, take time to record yourself talking in a room. Set it down on an oven mitt, or folded kitchen towel, as we have discussed and then sit in various places in relationship to the device to see how the microphone picks up different positions and distances. (You will also get a sense of what ambient noises it tends to pick up as well.) Make sure you know how to use the software, if you are using an iOS or Android device, and that the software is storing the recording some place from which you can later get it. Also make sure that you have enough room on your device to make a recording. That may mean letting the recording run for ten minutes and then seeing how much room the file it creates takes up. Multiply that number times 6 for a one hour session and times 12 for a two hour session. Does your device have enough storage room? (Make sure you turn a radio or television on so that if you are recording to a compressed format, the device has something to record.) The recording software for iOS and Android devices is an ever-changing landscape. Popular Science has some recommendations . The app that I have used on my iOS device is CaptureAudio . It has direct DropBox sync, which has been very reliable for me \u2013 obviously I wait until I have a wifi connection before I sync.","title":"Course Project"},{"location":"335/media/#course-project","text":"","title":"Course Project"},{"location":"335/media/#requirements","text":"The goal of this course is for participants not only to understand the nature of folk culture as it is situated in Louisiana but also to contribute to the documentation and broader understanding of folk culture.

Make sure you know how to use the software, if you are using an iOS or Android device, and that the software is storing the recording some place from which you can later get it. Also make sure that you have enough room on your device to make a recording. That may mean letting the recording run for ten minutes and then seeing how much room the file it creates takes up. Multiply that number times 6 for a one hour session and times 12 for a two hour session. Does your device have enough storage room? (Make sure you turn a radio or television on so that if you are recording to a compressed format, the device has something to record.) The recording software for iOS and Android devices is an ever-changing landscape. Popular Science has some recommendations . The app that I have used on my iOS device is CaptureAudio .

Towards that end, each participant is responsible for contributing to our understanding of Louisiana folk culture by writing a 2500-word paper based on the documentation and analysis of folk narrative as captured on a recording which will also be submitted along with the proper documentation. Papers and records must possess the following dimensions: First, and foremost, they must be accessionable : you and the people whom you document must be willing to have the work done be a part of the public record. In the case of a great deal of material, this means it is publishable upon final submission. In the case of sensitive material, this may mean a delay in publication, waiting for the sensitivity to pass. This is something to negotiate between participants, the people they document, and the instructor. (It goes without saying that the work must also be verifiable by the instructor.) Second, the documentation must be consumable : written texts must be readable by general as well as specialist audiences. Recordings must be listenable. (If video, it must be watchable.) This means raw audio or video files with poor sound and bad lighting are not acceptable. In addition, please be sure that your paper has, in addition to the necessary background information about performers and their texts, an analytical dimension, making a clear case for why a text is not only interesting but also important in terms of understanding some aspect of folk narrative. That means that anything that is the focus of a project must be: Traditional . While the world is filled with interesting people doing interesting things, and kooky people doing kooky things, folklore studies is not about the interesting nor the kooky: it is about the things we find so significant that we repeat them. Traditions can be, however, quite small. Families, even just nuclear families, can have sayings and stories that are an integral, or marginal, part of how they communicate with each other. But within any object, it is the temporal dimension that gives it depth. Tangible . While we do not normally think of texts as something we touch, we do. This is a research project in a university course: it must have at its foundation evidence that can be quantified: a discrete set of recordings that contain a discrete number of texts that will themselves be the object of analysis. Tractable . It makes no sense to collect evidence if you do not plan to do anything with it. Accurate description with some analysis\u2013that is, breaking a larger whole into its discrete parts so that the reader understands the mechanics behind the art\u2013is critical to a successful submission. *","title":"Requirements"},{"location":"335/project/#specifications","text":"The project must be submitted both electronically and as a hard copy.

John Laudun, HLG 356, Tuesdays 9:00\u20132:30 and by appointment. Course Description Someone once called Louisiana a \u201cfolklore land\u201d and we do live in a state, and in a region of the state, where folklore not only abides in abundance but is the subject of a great deal of attention by scholars and citizens, tourists and natives. This course encourages students to take a closer look for themselves not only at the folklore that surrounds and swathes each of us but also at the various ways it has been and is currently being represented. Taking a closer look requires students to go out and \u201csee\u201d for themselves various aspects of Louisiana folklife \u2013 some of this will be fieldwork and some of this is simply participatory \u2013 but such activities are a requisite part of the course. Course Objectives This course is designed with three simple goals in mind: (1) that students possess a basic understanding of the scientific and historical contexts for understanding the cultures of southwest Louisiana, (2) that students engage in at least one documentary project which contributes to our understanding of the people who make up Louisiana, and (3) that students produce one piece of high quality documentary writing. Course Texts & Materials Ancelet, Pitre, Edwards. 1986. Cajun Country. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi. Ancelet, Barry Jean. 1994. Cajun and Creole Folktales: The French Oral Tradition of South Louisiana. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi. Gaudet, Marcia and James McDonald (ed). 2003. Mardi Gras, Gumbo, and Zydeco. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi. Other course expenses may or may not include admission fees to area folklife parks and/or supplies for recording and producing various kinds of documentary projects. The text books listed above offer a general background and some specific treatments of topics central to the study of south Louisiana\u2019s folk cultures. They operate in the background, with suggested readings timed to make your understanding of particular lectures, discussions, or activities more profound and complete. Any and all materials found in the texts can, and will be on any quiz or exam. Please note that in addition to the texts above, I am also experimenting this semester with the posting of a small collection of documentary films on our course\u2019s Moodle site. Some viewings will be required in advance of a particular class, so that we may focus our discussion in the wake of the viewing. Other viewings will operate as background material for our discussions, but do be aware that they will be on the exams. In all cases, these documentaries are copyrighted materials that we are allowed to use in educational contexts thanks to the Fair Use provision of the copyright laws. Do not under any circumstances copy these materials in any fashion. Doing so risks more pain, bad feelings, and perhaps legal penalties than any of us can imagine. All you need to do is find yourself a reasonably good network connection and the hour or so that viewing the video requires. Open your browser, click on the link, take notes. Nothing more. Course Requirements To meet the course objectives enumerated above students must attend both in-class lectures and discussions as well as view a number of materials made available to them as part of this class. This course is best when taken by independent, self-motivated learners. The materials we deal with come from life itself: there are often no clear-cut lines and, indeed, sometimes the materials themselves can be inflammatory or embarrassing. Assignments PARTICIPATION & QUIZZES (20%). Regular participation means being in class (on time), prepared, and participating actively both through listening and through talking. No more than two absences will be excused without consent of the instructor. As noted above, the chief delivery vehicle for information in this course is in class. From time to time, to check for comprehension and currency, I give in-class quizzes, which are folded into your participation grade. Unlike the exams, which are scheduled in advance and can also be made up, quizzes are one-time-only affairs. EXAMS (30%). There are two exams in this course, which cover materials from lectures, discussions, readings, and viewings. The purpose of the exams is for you to demonstrate to me and to yourself your knowledge and comprehension of the theoretical and historical material presented in class. Without that foundation, then much of the rest of the course will do you little good. FOLKLORE DOCUMENTATION (50%). This course has at its core a collaborative project: an encyclopedia of Louisiana folklore collected, compiled, and crafted by you. Some parts of it will be straightforward data entry. Other parts will be based on your own research. The nature of your contribution is to be decided in consultation with me and your fellow classmates. Emergency Evacuation Procedures A map of this floor is posted near the elevator marking the evacuation route and \u201cDesignated Rescue Area.\u201d Students who need assistance should identify themselves to the instructor. Contact Information Do not hesitate. Immediately look around where you are sitting and get the name and number of two responsible looking people. Not the cute man nor woman \u2014 because getting his or her number that way would be just creepy, but someone who has at least your level of maturity, if not higher. Contact: Contact: The Fine Print Much of the information to be gleaned from the formal instruction in this course is in the lectures I give, the discussions we have, and the documentaries we view. That means that attendance is foundational to a student\u2019s success in this course. What happens in any given class of this course cannot be found anywhere else. If you must miss a class, please contact one of the people whose names you entered in this syllabus for notes on what you missed. Additionally, it cannot be emphasized enough that this is a class in folk culture, which is typically learned, practically by definition, outside the sphere of formal instruction. This course is designed to provide, within the walls of the classroom, students with a basic grounding in the theory of folklore studies, the principle dynamics of most folk cultures, the history that informs Louisiana\u2019s folk cultural matrix, and particular examples drawn from particular Louisiana folk cultures. All of this will be foundational to your understanding and appreciation of either the folk cultures with which you grew up and/or in which you now find yourself immersed. No understanding will be complete without any experience of folk culture itself. A number of the activities in this class require students to interact with practitioners of a Louisiana folk culture. For most, this is typically family and friends, but it could be mean, for some, having to interview with individuals you know less well. Please be sensible in doing this. Because all experience unfolds across time, often a significant amount of time, students must be prepared to spend time outside of class, interacting with others in a thoughtful way that respects not only others but that this experience is a part of their own education. A lack of seriousness and a lack of respect for all involved \u2014 instructor, one\u2019s self, fellow students, folk practitioners \u2014 represents a failure to grasp the root ideas and issues of folklore studies and of this course. Students displaying a lack of respect will find themselves in conference with the instructor and then the dean of students. Part of taking yourself, your learning, and this course seriously is that you agree to all the rules and guidelines on academic honesty laid out in the Student Bulletin. Plagiarism and cheating in this course will result, at the very least, in failure of the assignment; it can also mean failing the course immediately and, potentially, expulsion from the university. If in doubt about what to do or how to handle material not your own in your work, please see me. Helping you to figure that stuff out is part of my job. While it is my profoundest wish that this course be a fun and exhilarating one, it is one which will require attention and effort on all our parts to be so. It is my privilege to teach this course, and I do my best to be as prepared as I can be for all eventualities. I expect the same of you. That said, part of our effort to have the best possible classroom experience is leaving other things outside: pagers, cell phones, food, drinks, materials for other classes, etc. Please turn off any and all of these devices before entering the classroom. If yours go off, you will be excused from class. You are, however, permitted to use a laptop computer for taking notes \u2014 do not abuse your time, my time, or UWIN surfing the web (again, you will be excused from class immediately) as well as an audio recorder. Please do note that I regularly incorporate a variety of copyrighted material within my lectures that may or may not be indicated in the course of a lecture, and that any remaining materials are copyrighted by me. By granting you permission to record lectures, I do so with the understanding that the recordings will only be for your use and only your use in the pursuit of your education. You may not share copyrighted materials with others. By the same token, I take your intellectual productivity and property equally seriously. Students who generate quality documentation of a person, place, event, or behavior are regularly encouraged to submit their materials to the Archives of Cajun and Creole Folklore. I may also ask a student for permission to retain a copy of your materials for use in future classes. I try to return materials in an orderly fashion, but time sometimes works against such efforts. Any and all materials belonging to you that are left in my possession at the end of the semester will probably be disposed in the first few weeks of the following semester unless you indicate otherwise \u2014 I simply don\u2019t have room to store all student materials forever in my tiny office. Course Schedule The schedule flexes in response to student interested, experience, and expertise. I have found in the past that when I posted a series of dates, that it confuses students when we either move more quickly or more slowly than those dates suggested we might. The best way to track this course if, first, to use your own notes, but you will also find that the lecture outlines posted on Moodle will give you a reasonable indication of where we have been and where we are going.","title":"Syllabus 2012"},{"location":"335/syllabus-2016/","text":"English 335: Louisiana Folklore Course Logistics Meetings: 11:00\u201311:50 MW(F), HLG 321 Instructor: Pr.

Course Description For better or worse, folklore in Louisiana has been and is subject to a great deal of attention by scholars and citizens, tourists and natives. This course encourages students to take a closer look for themselves not only at the folklore that surrounds and shapes each of us but also at the various ways it has been and is currently being represented. Taking a closer look requires students to go out and observe and document for themselves various aspects of Louisiana folklife and to participate in the expansion of the archeological/historical record of the region. Course Objective The goal of this course is for each student to produce one archive-quality piece of documentation of a traditional practice that occurs in Louisiana, or, in the case of historical practices, that used to occur in the region. Archive quality will be discussed in some detail in the course, but in this initial moment it includes, in addition to the item itself, which can be a text or an artifact, all appropriate and necessary documentation. The complete record will be ready to be uploaded into a digital archive by the end of the semester.

Other course expenses may or may not include admission fees to area folklife parks and/or supplies for recording and producing documentation projects. Most modern devices are sufficiently general purpose in nature to provide the ability to record audio, video, or images of sufficient quality for our purposes, but it will require proficiency and deliberation on your part to do so.

Course Requirements To meet the course objectives enumerated above, students must attend both in-class lectures and discussions as well as engage a number of materials made available to them as part of this class and engage themselves in a number of assignments outside of the classroom. Thus, this course is best enjoyed, and profited by, when taken by independent, self-motivated learners. This course also requires a reasonable level of emotional maturity, since folklore is \u201cequipment for living\u201d and materials we deal with come from life itself, where lines are often not clear-cut and, sometimes the matters with which we deal are inflammatory or embarrassing. Participants must be prepared for this. Intolerance will, as it were, not be tolerated. For more on what is required for this course, please see The Fine Print document.

Course Project Your goal for this course, for your term project, is to document an instance of Louisiana folk culture for yourself. Or, maybe, it would be better to think about it as just culture, and, even then, think about it as things people say and do every day. If you begin there, then in a dialogue with the rest of us, we can decide on what would be more significant and/or important to document and what would be less significant. The end result of your work will be both a report with a proper documentation of the text(s) and the context(s) within which it/they occurred. The context will be not only the immediate social context but also the larger cultural and historical context for the individuals involved, as we have seen already in a number of examples \u2013 and there will be more examples either discussed in class or posted on-line. The paper detailing all this particular information will be held in private in the archive of Louisiana folk culture that we are building together. The documentation of the text itself, and those dimensions of the context that can be properly abstracted so as to be useful to other/future researchers, will be in the form of a TEI document. For reference, a basic TEI version of the \u201cThe Spirit Controller and the Bull\u201d drawn from Barry Ancelet\u2019s Cajun and Creole Folktales would look something like this: TEI xmlns=\u201dhttp://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\u201d> I went to meet an old man in Marrero, and he told me a story. He went to look for a treasure with some other men. And there was a controller who had brought a Bible to control the spirits. And when they arrived at the site, they saw a big horse coming through the woods with a man riding it, and when he dismounted, it was no longer a man on the horse. It was a dog. And he said the dog came and rubbed itself against his legs. He said it was growling. He said he knew the dog was touching him, but he didn\u2019t feel anything. It was like there was just a wind. And he said they all took off running. He lost his hat and his glasses and he tore all his clothes. And even the controller ran off and he never saw his Bible again after that. Considerably more elaboration is possible, and we will explore what elaborations are necessary and/or preferable as we work through your projects both individually and communally. I present this simple instance of TEI here for you to begin to become familiar, and comfortable, with it. Many of you have never seen the HTML that powers the websites on which you depend \u2013 try finding View Source in one of the menus of your browser. TEI is like HTML, in that it is a markup language in which a great deal of metadata can be supplied and acted upon. Another powerful markup language, of which some of you may have heard that developed as TEI developed, is XML. All of these markup languages depended upon extensive uses of tags that are marked by being inside angle brackets, < and >, that are usually paired, such that, as above, a tag that marks the beginning of a text, , is accompanied by one that marks the end, . None of this is hard in and of itself. What is challenging is the application of tags that are relevant to the material at hand. In most instances, these tags are analytical in nature, meaning they are the product of an analyst tackling a particular dimension of a text, and so what tags that are included in these documents will be a mix of those required and those you find interesting. An example of what a marked up text looks like can be found at TEI by example. The report and the TEI transcript are complementary as well in terms of requirements: shorter transcripts will require longer reports, and vice versa. Your goal for this project is some combination of documents that result in approximately 3500 words. Before you ask, yes you can go over, and the more you go over with reasonably good material, the higher your grade is likely to be. Like in the real world, high performance receives high marks. On Recording Equipment Because this is a class within a literature department, we are focused mostly on verbal texts. Other kinds of \u201ctexts\u201d are not off-limits, but they do, in having different dimensions, present different issues when it comes to data capture. While we must recognize that there is more to any text than simply its words and the vocal medium in which it is conveyed \u2013 that is, the linguistic and paralinguistic dimensions of a spoken text \u2013 it is also the case that written texts and audio recordings are much smaller in size than video recordings, and much easier to handle as a result. Software For most of us, the voice memo app that comes with most smart phones will do the trick, so long as your clear on how to get recordings off the device: in most instances, it should be fairly easy to email the recording to yourself, or, in the case of the Voice Memos app in iOS, to sync them to off-device storage. (iOS\u2019s Voice Memos will sync audio files to the Notes application, for example, which you should then be able to open on your Mac, provided you have a Mac and you have signed up for their iCloud service.) There are a lot of other sound recording apps available for smart phones. I have used a few, including both FiRe (Field Recorder) and CaptureAudio. I use the latter more often these days, but both are fine. I prefer to use dedicated audio recording apps because they allow you to choose the format in which you record your audio. Like almost all digital media formats, audio recordings come in both uncompressed, or \u201craw\u201d, and compressed forms. Most of you are familiar with, and indeed rely upon, a compressed format known as MP3. For my own fieldwork, when it is my research (and my reputation) on the line, I use an uncompressed format known as AIFF. See the note about CODECS below. Hardware Some of you may own and use, or have a friend or family member who uses, a dedicated camera, either a point and shoot or what is known as a DSLR. You are thus familiar with the idea that while the audio capture capabilities of your smart phone is \u201cgood enough\u201d for most purposes, it is not terribly good at it in particular. There are a couple of ways to improve this situation, and they involve purchasing additional equipment (or hardware). Microphones The simplest, and least expensive, option to enhance your audio recording capabilities is to purchase a microphone: almost any external microphone will be better than the one built into your smart phone, which, to be honest, wasn\u2019t chosen for the quality of its audio capture so much as its ability to fit into the small case of your phone and that it didn\u2019t cost very much. Please be careful when buying a microphone to purchase the appropriate cable that will link it to your device. Most professional recording equipment uses a grounded connection known as XLR, which is a three-prong connector. Most consumer devices, especially small devices, use an eighth-inch or \u201cmini\u201d jack with a TRS (Tip-Ring-Sleeve) or TRRS (Tip-Ring-Ring-Sleeve) arrangement for stereo audio input and output. (And do be aware that an XLR to mini-jack cable loses its grounded nature, which means that other electrical fields in an environment can affect your recording.) Recorders Moving away from using your smart phone, the next step you can take is to invest in a separate device. I generally advise against this for a couple of reasons: mostly because with a good microphone and a good audio recording application, your smart phone or tablet or computer is an awfully good portable sound studio and one you already own. (So, something you already own is good, and, perhaps just as importantly, something you already carry around.) For some, however, a separate device is preferable. Perhaps your phone is really old, or maybe it\u2019s already crammed full of data and apps \u2013 remember, using any device to capture data means you are going to increase your storage needs. Or perhaps you would just have a separate device to do this kind of thing. If that\u2019s the case, then I have a couple of suggestions to make. Let me begin with the device that I use, an Roland R-09 recorder, which is no longer available, but the Roland R-05 is, and it is cheaper and better than the R-09. Both units have built-in microphones that are better than most smart phones, and they are both lightweight and dependable. They both also use widely available standard batteries (2 AA) and SD cards. You can plug an external microphone, and you can also attach either device directly to your computer for transferring files via a USB mini cable. Smaller in size, and in price, than the Roland units and also widely popular is the TASCAM DR-05. The TASCAM DR-05 gives you much the same functionality and flexibility. Most people I know who use one don\u2019t even bother to use a microphone, but the unit does accept one. Both of these devices make it dead simple, thanks to their removable media, to move your audio recordings from the device itself to your computer. That\u2019s an important feature. Less expensive devices can sometimes make this more difficult. Here\u2019s a quick summary of other options: The Olympus voice recorders, like the Olympus VN-2700 for example, are very inexpensive and work well \u2013 but you must remember to turn off voice activation! \u2013 but getting the recordings off the device requires some work on the user\u2019s part. (And it\u2019s not a digital transfer but a matter of playing the audio into the computer.) The SONY ICD PX333 Digital Voice Recorder uses AAA batteries and removable media, but it only records in mono MP3 format. (That\u2019s an allowable option for this class, and for voice recording in general, but it is a limitation, and the Sony is a little more expensive.) The iGearPro Voice Activated Audio Recorder does allow you to turn the voice activation off, and it also allows you to connect the device directly to your computer in order to transfer files from the device. I have never used the MaxPro-Best USB Flash Drive Voice Recorder but it looks dead simple and it\u2019s very inexpensive. \ufffc PDFs must be printed out \u2014 the most recommended option because paper is rugged and lightweight \u2014 or available on a large tablet (a 10\u201d screen or larger) or laptop. Consulting a PDF on a smart phone is not an option. Not having the relevant text in class on the day it is to be discussed results in a lowered participation grade. Please budget/plan appropriately.","title":"Syllabus 2016"},{"location":"dh/dedeo/","text":"Final paper Read one of the books below and extract a specific claim the author makes about cognition, culture, socie\u00ad ty, or political life.

Course Description In general, there is a cluster of issues that concern humanists: all of them revolve around the production of cultural expressive forms and the relationship between individual expression and the communities in which these forms emerge. The digital humanities represent the merging of two areas of activity that have run for a long time as distinct concerns: humanities computing and the use and study of digital media \u2014 sometimes known as new media. The digital humanities have the potential both to develop new kinds of analyses and publications as well as to re-invigorate present practices, and even to renew practices (e.g., indices) that have become disused in our current era. This course surveys issues and activities in order to acquaint students with the overall landscape of the digital humanities. We will, over the course of the semester examine textual markup and its uses, databases and their uses, approaches to visualization and distant reading, network theory, and corpus methodologies. The course requires no prior knowledge of the digital humanities, but it does assume familiarity with computers and their standard uses (word processing, web browsing, etc.). Participants engage in a number of exploratory activities and small projects, which are intended to make it possible for them to choose a larger project on which to work which suits their own interests and expertise as well as the requirements suggested by the research itself \u2014 which is something that the digital humanities can offer: matching the publication \u2014 text, photo gallery, audio or video netcast \u2014 to the topic being considered. Course Texts and Other Accessories The texts I plan(ned) to use for this seminar are below, but only buy the first one. The Schriebman et al. text is expensive, and I am trying to determine if there is an alternative. Required Moretti, Franco. 2007. Maps, Graphs, and Trees . Verso. (ISBN: 1844671852) Schriebman, Siemens, Unsworth (ed). 2008. A Companion to Digital Humanities . Wiley-Blackwell. (ISBN: 1405168064). (An on-line version of the text is available .) Recommended Eric Raymond\u2019s The Cathedral and the Bazaar was, and is, an essential description, and somewhat of a manifesto, for open source software and thus of open, or community, source materials in general. The link is to the postscript of the document, which gives you the entire book in one link, but there is are other versions available. Why open source might be interesting to a humanist might be more clearly articulated by Lawrence Lessig in Free Culture . Lessig is a professor of law at Stanford University and a long-time advocate for a creative commons. (The book is also available in paperback in almost any bookstore as well as in an on-line HTML version.) We will be reading a lot of e-texts. Participants must decide for themselves how they want to interact with those documents \u2013 remember either to figure printing costs into the costs of the course and/or the time required to print for free on campus in the various venues. (Be aware of any printing restrictions.) We will also be using two web applications/services, Wordpress.com and Dropbox.com , both of which offer better experiences with some kind of broadband connection. A lot of the software we will be using in the course of the seminar is open source. That does not necessarily mean that it runs on any platform. In the lab we have the advantage of machines that can boot both into Mac OS X, which is a Unix, as well as Windows. If participants wish to use the software elsewhere, they will need to calculate the cost, either monetarily or in terms of time (and perhaps both), to set up their own systems. In addition to these potential costs, there is also the matter of portable storage. Media production, especially video, can take up quite a bit of storage space. (One hour of compressed video takes up about 5GB.) Participants interested in working with large resolution image, audio, or video files will want to invest either in a very large flash drive or in a modest external hard drive. The Macintosh Pros in the lab support both USB and Firewire 800 devices. Assignments and Grading This is an exploratory course in the digital humanities and for the digital humanities at the university. As such it depends greatly upon your participation , which includes your willingness to try a wide variety of things out, some (or even many) of which may not appear to you either at first glance or ever to have a meaningful outcome. To some degree this uncertainty in meaning is a function of how new the \u201cfield\u201d of digital humanities is not only to you but also in the academy. For example, I will require all of us, including me, to free write for five minutes at the beginning of every seminar. I do so not only because I think free writing is an important life skill, one useful far beyond the immediate impact it may have on making you a productive scholar, but also because we will, later in the course, need some data with which to work. If nothing else, you will have a data set consisting of your free writing. So that\u2019s at least two activities upon which you will be graded. In addition to these activities, I will ask you to write a pre- and a post-seminar essay in which you describe what you know and what you wish to know, as well as later what you learned, about the digital humanities. Again, some of you will recognize this as the KWL activity, and I offer it as something useful not only in your own work, both in your scholarship and in your teaching, but also something useful no matter what career your pursue. The larger assignment you have in this course is an essay/project in which you try out some of the ideas and methods we explore in the course of the seminar to a topic or a body of content with which you are familiar. The essay should document the methodology you used, the results you acquired, and how these results relate to results of more traditional forms of scholarship. (Remember, scholarship itself has undergone radical changes in the last fifty years, and so we should never imagine in the course of this seminar that we are working from a static base.)

I initially imagined that each of us might be free to work with an already established infrastructure, but that makes our ability to \u201cfollow\u201d each other too limited, difficult, or uneven \u2013 some platforms do a better job of \u201cfollowing\u201d than other platforms. (I have written about platforms in various ways: here\u2019s one post .There are many free offerings currently available but the key is to find one that will also allow us to export our data for other uses. One of our first seminars will be dedicated to establishing a parallel \u201cdigital\u201d infrastructure for us as a group. Session Links We are going to be using WordPress.com , where each of us will maintain an individual blog. Like Tumblr and Facebook, WP.com users have the ability to \"follow\" other users, and we are going to be using that system as a way to create an on-line conversation for our seminar. For more information about WordPress.com, go here . Wordpress.com hosts their own tutorials . ## The Larger Context I: The University The readings for our next unit stretch across three seminars and focus on the larger context for the digital humanities themselves: that is, in approximate order, the university, its faculty, and their productions in transition. For many of you, these documents will not be the kind of thing you are used to reading in a graduate course. These are reports by and for institutions, and they are written and structured with a particular rhetoric and logic that you may find difficult and/or tedious. Keep reading. Find a way to skim the document or a section and then come back and read with more care particular passages or points that you think are important either to the document itself or to you. (And it's important that you be able to distinguish between the two.) *Nota bene*: All the links below take you to the originating sites for these documents. There are a couple of reasons for linking to these sites. First, this is proper \"netiquette\": link to the content creator to be sure your audience credits them for the work. (You are always free to keep a copy for yourself somewhere in case the URL decays -- more on this in class some time.) Second, I want to give you the chance to explore these sites for themselves. The links to download the PDFs may not be readily apparent on each page, but they are there, I assure you. Also, when in doubt, download the full report. Even if I indicate that you will be focusing your energy on the executive summary, you will want the full report for any references it may contain -- and the full report always contains the executive summary. For our first meeting in this sequence, you will want to read the following: * The Future of Learning Institutions in a Digital Age (John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Reports on Digital Media and Learning). Read the overview for the entities mentioned and then the rest of the chapters. * University Publishing in the Digital Age (Ithaka). Focus your efforts on the executive summary. * Assessing the Future of Scholarly Communication (UC's Center for the Study of Higher Education). Read the executive summary, paying especial attention to the \"Summary of Findings,\" \"Identifying Faculty Needs, and the \"Introduction and Overview of the Disciplines.\" In the last section, you will probably end up skimming through the various disciplines but be sure you slow down to read the sections devoted to the disciplines closest to English: History and Music. ## The Larger Context II: The Humanities In our second examination of the larger context for the digital humanities, we narrow our focus from \"the university\", or \"the academy,\" to the humanities themselves. This time we are reading documents from the American Council of Learned Societies, to which both the American Folklore Society and the Modern Language Association belong, as well as from MLA itself. In moving from large institutions to disciplines, and their practitioners, the discussion also shifts to how those practitioners might navigate the emergent landscape being maintained/created by universities as the universities themselves try to adapt to new realities. Of course, one of the ways that universities do this is through the practitioners that people them. Don't worry if the complexity of all this begin doesn't make sense to you right away. Most graduate students think of themselves as apprentices to a discipline and/or a field. (We will explore domain/discpline versus field later.) There is, however, an increasing push to make graduate students more aware of themselves as novices to a practice. As such, one of the things of which you need to be aware is the reward structures for things like tenure and promotion. In order to understand the changing nature of scholarly communication, we are reading both a report from the producer's side (MLA) as well as a report from the distributor's side, (ARL, the Association for Research Libraries). Here are the links: ACLS's Our Cultural Commonwealth MLA's Report from Task Force on Evaluating Scholarship for Tenure and Promotion ARL's Current Models of Digital Scholarly Communication As before, the links above do not take you directly to the downloads, so spend at least a few minutes looking around. The ARL page alone has a dozen publications listed before you get to the one we will be reading; at least scan the titles and take a peek at one or two. ## The Larger Context III: The Digital Humanities Our third and final seminar on \"the larger context\" brings us, at long last, to the digital humanities themselves. The first two of our readings for this seminar are from the Companion to the Digital Humanities (also listed in the Syllabus and on the Resources pages and hereafter acronymized to CDH). Roberto Busa's Foreword to the CDH. Susan Hockey's \" History of Humanities Computing \" (in the CDH). Greg Crane's \"Classics and the Computer\" (also in the CDH) is optional, but worth reading since its written by one of the early practitioners. William Pannapacker's live-blog post from the 2011 MLA. ( Here is his 2009 post.) And here's the 2008 Brainstorm post (Brainstorm is another CHE series) by Stanley Katz that started UL-Lafayette on its way to being a part of Project Bamboo . Finally, just to throw a little something into our conversation, here's a recent job posting on CHE for a director of digital humanities. To be sure, there is more to read. There was an a fairly long thread on The Humanist mailing list recently about defining the digital humanities, but I want us to take up that discussion later in the seminar, when we have had more hands-on experience with various ideas, tools, and methodologies. ### Link List for the Seminar \"Three Days of the Condor\" (on Netflix ). The history of PC hardware, in pictures (on Royal Pingdom). Errol Morris has produced a history of IBM, with music by Philip Glass: IBM Centennial Film: They Were There - People who changed the way the world works . It's half an hour long, but it's worth it, if only for the archival film footage. Timeline of Computer History (at the Computer History Museum). History of Computer Hardware (on Wikipedia). The Perseus Project . Simile Widgets : Timeline . Literary and Linguistic Computing (journal). Computing and the Humanities (journal, 1966-2004). ## How the Web Works Now that we have begun to live our digital lives in \u201cthe cloud\u201d; it\u2019s time to begin to understand how \u201cthe cloud,\u201d which used to be called \u201cthe web\u201d (and sometimes \u201cthe net\u201d) works. Google has provided a decent introduction in its 20 Things I Learned . ### Assignment For the assignment, seminar participants must self-identify as either technological or not-technological , which may be best revealed by reading the first few \"chapters\" of the book. If the acronyms and technologies being discussed are already familiar to you, then you should probably consider yourself technological . If the various capitalized letters strike you as so much alphabet soup and the description of the processes involved come across as a weird exercise in abstract expressionism, then you should probably consider yourself not-technological . Please note that these appellations are only for the purposes of this assignment and they make no grander distinctions about your technological knowledge and ability nor do they reflect upon your worth as a person. Instead, the distinctions merely give you a starting place for how you are to respond to the text. Imagine that you are an editor at a press to whom this manuscript has been submitted. The editor in chief has handed the manuscript to you either because she knows of your technological expertise and wants you to comment on it from that perspective or because she knows that you are not, and what wants to hear from that point of view. If you are technological , then you part of your response to the book should be based on what you think the book left out that it should not have or what it failed to explain or contextualize properly. If you are not-technological , then part of your response to the book should be based on what it failed to explain properly, detailing where you felt confused or left behind/out. Whether you are technological or not, another part of your response to the book must, as a good editor, be about what the book does well. Who does it assume as its audience? What knowledge does it presume its audience possesses? Etc. By the way, if you think this \"think like an editor\" is part of a larger program to think about your own writing from the point of view of journal editors and press editors and thus to begin to think about audiences and markets, then ... you are exactly right. ### Session Links One of the things to remember is that the web's infrastructure is itself dynamic. You may have heard about the the new standard for HTML, HTM5. I highly recommend Dive into HTML5 as a primer on what the changes are and what you can do with the new functionalities. And here's a terrific article from four years ago discussing HTML5 as an emergent standard: from IBM no less . Want to see what a website/page looks like in an older version of Internet Explorer: try it in NetRenderer . ### Session Assignment In class we will view the source of your own blog and identify the constituent parts. For the purposes of this exercise, we are going to do this by copying the contents of the source and pasting it into a Word document. You will then color the head of the document red. Leave the body of the document black, but then begin to break apart the various divs. You may choose to color these divs, or use Word's border functionality, but you must divide the body of the HTML file into its constituent parts. ## Digital Document Realities Much of our data is contained in digital containers which are, largely, invisible to us except when we come across a file that we cannot open. Only then do we pay attention to the file type, often expressed as an extension, like DOC or JPG or MP3 . What are these file types? What do they really look like under the surface? How do they work? Our focus in this sessions will be, quite literally, seeing for ourselves what makes up the documents on which we depend. ### Readings Much of the academic world, and many of you, depend upon Microsoft Word, but how much do you know about the application? Wikipedia's history is a nice place to start. Pay especial attention to the discussion of Word's various file formats . The entry on Word mentions two alternate file formats, one now old and one still somewhat new . \".doc\" is a file extension. Next session we are going to encounter a \".pl\" extension. What does \".pl\" mean? Have you thought about file extensions? It's time . ### Assignment Bring at least two files that contain documents or information that is important to you. Don't think about what file format or what document type they are. Just bring them. While you are at it, and you are loading up your Dropbox folder or your flash drive, why not toss some other files that you use regularly into the same directory. (The word directory is becoming more familiar to you, yes? If not, then you need to read up on it .) Some sample files from my own world: PNG, TIFF, CR2, MP3, AAC, M4A, RTF, DOCX . (This list alone should reveal something at least one distinction to a trained eye.) List the various types of files and describe what they do, from your point of view. ## Your New Best Friend Your new best friend this semester is usually known as a text editor. There are a number of options available to you, depending upon your preferred platform and upon your willingness to pay for others\u2019 work. (I have said more about on my own blog .) ### Choosing a Text Editor My very best advice is that you find the editor that works best for you first, without regard to price. Most of these applications are modestly priced and finding the right one for you means not only you enjoying your work more -- after all, an application is part of your environment -- but also finding an application with which you will grow. E.g., many of my editor's shortcuts are now part of my muscle memory. Lifehacker has polled its readers on a semi-regular basis about what text editors they use. In 2010, these were the top five . They have also echoed the coder's mantra that you need to learn how to use the command line editor vi . For Windows PCs the short version of the Lifehacker poll is that NotePad++ , followed closely by UltraEdit and TextPad , is a perennial favorites. NotePad++ is free and open source. UltraEdit and TextPad are shareware and must be paid for at some point. (Always check on academic or student discounts.) There are many more text editors for Windows PCs. For Mac PCs, the usual face off is between TextMate and BBEdit . The good folks at Bare Bones Software, makers of BBEdit, also offer a free version of the editor, with less functionality, called TextWrangler . For those who insist upon only open source software, Smultron was once open source , but is now available for the pocket gouging price of $5. I am less familiar with the Linux world of GUI text editors. I know Gedit and Kedit are popular in their respective desktop environments of Gnome and KDE, but I am not familiar with either one. JEdit is a cross-platform editor written in Java, obviously. I have used it, but its non-native UI makes it less user friendly to me, but I spend most of my time on a Mac PC. There's even a web-based text editor . Look around. Try a few. I can't emphasize enough the power of syntax highlighting or color coding of elements within a document. (I'll show you examples in class.) It's especially important to anyone interested in really getting involved with TEI . ### Living with/in a Text Editor It may surprise you to learn that your new best friend is capable of a great deal more than simply peering inside files, the way we did last class, and editing HTML and CSS files the way we discussed last week. It is a quite capable platform for a wide variety of document production, as we will explore in the weeks to come, and it is, for some, a way of life. For some, the answer to everything is a BATF. ( See Giles Turnbull's \"Living in Text Files.\" ) Cory Doctorow -- and you should know who Doctorow is (Google him right now if you don't -- go ahead, I'll wait) -- posted Danny O'Brien's lovely text file that compiles his notes on, well, text files. Both Turnbull and Doctorow mention something called a todo.txt. There is quite a cult gathered around todo.txt -- indeed as there is around any organizational tool -- and someone has even written a CLI tool to interact with your todo.txt file. ### Assignment One of the ways to demonstrate the power of text files is to see it in action. I am going to ask you to free write this afternoon in a text file. Somewhere along the way, I am also going to ask you to: Go to the Markdown project page and download the script. Unzip the file if you need to, and then copy or move the file to this location: ~/Library/Application Support/TextWrangler/Unix Support/Unix Filters. Quit TextWrangler and then re-start it. If you click on the hash-bang menu, you should now see Markdown.pl as an option. Select some text in your document -- or all the text in your document -- and try it out. ## MoMA recently acquired 23 typefaces http://kottke.org/11/01/moma-acquires-digital-typefaces-what-does-that-mean It was actually a fascinating conversation with MoMA, as we each worked to imagine how this bequest could be useful to the museum for eternity. What might it mean when the last computer capable of recognizing OpenType is gone? What will it mean when computers as we know them are gone? How does one establish the insurance value of a typeface: not its price, but the cost of maintaining it in working order? Digital artworks are prone to different kinds of damage than physical ones, but obsolescence is no less damaging to a typeface than earthquakes and floods to a painting. On the business side there are presumably insurance underwriters who can bring complex actuarial tables to bear on the issue, but I think it's an even more provocative issue for conservators. 472 years after its completion, the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel underwent a restoration that scholars still find controversial. What might it mean for someone to freshen up our typefaces in AD 2483? XML, TEI, & YOU Now that you have learned what documents look like, it\u2019s time for you to start making some. We will warm up with HTML, but proceed quickly to XML and the form of XML most popular among humanists, TEI. #### XML by itself is not very interesting. The real power of XML comes in what you can do with it by transforming it into other forms using XSLT. ### #### The Institute for Science, Innovation and Society (InSIS) is organising a two-day conference on 25-26 March 2011 at Sa\u00efd Business School, University of Oxford, with support from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and the Oxford e-Social Science project.

For more information about WordPress.com, go here . Wordpress.com hosts their own tutorials . ## The Larger Context I: The University The readings for our next unit stretch across three seminars and focus on the larger context for the digital humanities themselves: that is, in approximate order, the university, its faculty, and their productions in transition. For many of you, these documents will not be the kind of thing you are used to reading in a graduate course. These are reports by and for institutions, and they are written and structured with a particular rhetoric and logic that you may find difficult and/or tedious. Keep reading. Find a way to skim the document or a section and then come back and read with more care particular passages or points that you think are important either to the document itself or to you. (And it's important that you be able to distinguish between the two.) *Nota bene*: All the links below take you to the originating sites for these documents. There are a couple of reasons for linking to these sites. First, this is proper \"netiquette\": link to the content creator to be sure your audience credits them for the work. (You are always free to keep a copy for yourself somewhere in case the URL decays -- more on this in class some time.) Second, I want to give you the chance to explore these sites for themselves. The links to download the PDFs may not be readily apparent on each page, but they are there, I assure you. Also, when in doubt, download the full report. Even if I indicate that you will be focusing your energy on the executive summary, you will want the full report for any references it may contain -- and the full report always contains the executive summary. For our first meeting in this sequence, you will want to read the following: * The Future of Learning Institutions in a Digital Age (John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Reports on Digital Media and Learning). Read the overview for the entities mentioned and then the rest of the chapters. * University Publishing in the Digital Age (Ithaka). Focus your efforts on the executive summary. * Assessing the Future of Scholarly Communication (UC's Center for the Study of Higher Education). Read the executive summary, paying especial attention to the \"Summary of Findings,\" \"Identifying Faculty Needs, and the \"Introduction and Overview of the Disciplines.\" In the last section, you will probably end up skimming through the various disciplines but be sure you slow down to read the sections devoted to the disciplines closest to English: History and Music. ## The Larger Context II: The Humanities In our second examination of the larger context for the digital humanities, we narrow our focus from \"the university\", or \"the academy,\" to the humanities themselves.

There is, however, an increasing push to make graduate students more aware of themselves as novices to a practice. As such, one of the things of which you need to be aware is the reward structures for things like tenure and promotion. In order to understand the changing nature of scholarly communication, we are reading both a report from the producer's side (MLA) as well as a report from the distributor's side, (ARL, the Association for Research Libraries).

I\u2019m not going to lie. The web, however, is filled with content that was purposefully written to attract attention, i.e., clickbait . While I always encourage participants in my courses to use Wikipedia as a starting point, I also encourage them to go beyond an encyclopedia entry or two. The easiest next step is to find something in a specialist encyclopedia. The steps that follow are looking up topics in journals and in finding them in books. Using the Library in Person If you are on campus, it may be easier simply to use the library: Dupr\u00e9 Library is open, is also with some limits . Using the Library Virtually Please note that, in most cases, the direct link to the original source of an article or other kind of resource is posted in course materials: it\u2019s important that you understand for yourself from whence information comes and it is expected that you will take some time to chart the network of sources for yourself. In some cases, the linked material will be openly available and accessible to you. In other cases, the link will be to one of a number of content aggregators for which the university has subscribed to make access available to you. (Please remember that servers cost money, both in terms of hardware and in terms of the people who maintain the hardware and the software.

Citing sources in the author-date style consists of two parts: an in-text citation a reference list The in-text citation points the reader to the full information about the source found in the reference list. In-Text Citations An in-text citation provides your reader with two pieces of information: the the last name of the author(s) used in the corresponding reference list entry the year the work was published Enclose the author\u2019s last name and the year of publication in parentheses with no intervening punctuation: (Smith 2016) For no author, see the \u201cHow do I deal with ____?\u201d section. For two to three authors, include the last names of authors using commas and and : (Smith, Lee, and Alvarez 2016) For four or more authors, include the last name of the first author and et al. : (Smith et al. 2016) When editors, translators, or compilers are used as the author, do not include their role (trans., ed., comp.) in the in-text citation.

Some of that is about how we organize ourselves and some of that is simply guidance on reading, writing, and working that I have collected over the years and have found both useful and compelling to students. For a start, read Rob Jenkins\u2019 essay on \u201cDefining the Relationship.\u201d Jenkins is also a professor of English at a regional state university in the south. His approach is similar to mine. No, seriously, go read it. I\u2019ll wait. Ready to move on? Okay\u2026 A number of studies have pretty well established that while students, and many teachers, prefer the lecture model, wherein a professor professes and students study, students actually learn better when engaged in active learning. Despite the pretty incontrovertible proof of such studies, most teachers and students dislike active learning. For teachers, it\u2019s hard to organize activities that engage students effectively in the material while accommodating the range of student abilities \u2013 the lecture model assumes relatively little of student ability. For students, active learning requires being active in a context that they too often think of as a passive space. I try to keep a mix of lecture, discussion, and activity inside and outside the classroom in all the courses I facilitate, with the assumption being not only that different methods work for different people but also that even individuals need different things at different moments. Discussion, completion of assignments, and participation in course activities are an important part of how I structure a course. I prefer not to lecture from any given book so that I can add to our discussion and not repeat material found elsewhere \u2013 if repetition is important to you, then this may not be the course for you. Class meetings should be viewed in the same light as professionals view meetings in general: everyone arrives on time, if not early, and everyone takes notes no matter who is talking. (It goes without saying that you deserve everyone else\u2019s respect, and they deserve yours.) Note-taking is your responsibility, as is keeping up with what is happening or happened in class on a given day or what is due in class following your absence. (Not handing in an assignment because you didn\u2019t know about it because you missed class and did not contact one of your classmates still counts as not handing in the assignment.) Please write down the name and contact information of at least one other member of this class. The university maintains a strict absence policy. If an absence is at all foreseeable, especially if it falls on a due date, you should let me know as much in advance as you can in order to find a solution. The same goes for arriving late or departing early. If you are more than five minutes late, you will not be admitted to class \u2013 unless you have a very good narrative and can perform it with a zeal glimpsed only in performances by Cirque du Soleil or Frank Sinatra. Turn off all sources of distraction before coming into class. Cell phones must be set to silent and put away, unless you are expecting an emergency telephone call, in which case you should talk to me before class starts and sit near an exit so that you can excuse yourself and step outside to take the telephone call. Simon Sinek has a good account of how cell phones satisfy us and, at the same time, keep us from the kinds of actions that lead to long-term things like relationships and satisfaction. All of you have a copy of the Code of Student Ethics. If you do not, please get one. All forms of academic dishonesty \u2014 e.g., cheating on exams, plagiarism in papers \u2014 will be taken very seriously in this class. At minimum, you will receive an F on the assignment, but there is also the possibility of receiving an F in the course or being dismissed from the university. I personally do not want to consider the possibility of turning over the design of a bridge that my family will cross to an engineer who cheats nor the diagnosis of a medical condition to a doctor who cheats. Many of you are from Louisiana and remain in Louisiana and thus will remain a part of my world: being surrounded by individuals whom I trust and admire is important to me. Please give me every opportunity to do so. Drafts Learn how to use the Review functionality in your word processor. Once you and I have begun to swap copies of your draft, leave Track Changes on. I want you to be able to see the changes I have made so that you can make the same changes elsewhere in the draft. If you don\u2019t want to see those changes, there are view options, but please don\u2019t keep making new copies of your paper with all the revision notes lost. You need to see the process, and part of how I assess you is in the nature of your drafting and revising process. And, yes, learn how to use the style system functionality in your word processor. It\u2019s the twenty-first century, stop using your computer like it\u2019s a fancy typewriter (or a smart TV for that matter). It\u2019s a general purpose computing device, more powerful than all the machines in the room that landed a man on the moon, and all you do with it type papers (at the last minute), check social media, and find ways to avoid learning how to use databases. Institutional Necessities One day, the University will create a central resource that collects stuff like this, but until then, they ask faculty to include things like this: Emergency Evacuation Procedures A map of this floor is posted near the elevator marking the evacuation route and \u201cDesignated Rescue Area.\u201d Students who need assistance should identify themselves to the instructor. Accessibility Services, Disability Services, & Other Helpful People Students needing academic accommodations for a disability must first be registered with the Office of Disability Services (ODS) to verify the disability and to establish eligibility for accommodations. Students may call 337-482-5252 or visit the ODS office in the Conference Center, room 126. Once registered, students should then schedule an appointment with the professor to make appropriate arrangements. Paper Every piece of paper you hand in, I hand back. If you are not in class on the day I hand back a particular piece of paper, you will find it in the folder outside my office door. It will stay there until the first few weeks of the following semester, when I purge the previous semester to make way for new material.

It assumes the interviewer has at least a notepad in hand and, perhaps, basic recording technology. An interview is not a dialogue. The whole point of the interview is to get the narrator to tell her story. Limit your own remarks to a few pleasantries to break the ice, then brief questions to guide her along. It is not necessary to give her the details of your great-grandmother\u2019s life growing up in Abbeville in order to get her to tell you about her grandfather\u2019s trip to Texas. Just say, \u201cI understand your grandfather went to Texas during the oil boom. What did he tell you about his time there?\u201d Ask questions that require more of an answer than \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d Start with \u201cwhy,\u201d \u201chow,\u201d \u201cwhere,\u201d \u201cwhat kind of \u2026\u201d instead of \u201cWas Henry Miller a good boss?\u201d ask \u201cWhat did the drilling crew say about Henry Miller?\u201d Ask one question at a time. Sometimes interviewers ask a series of questions all at once. Probably the narrator will answer only the first or last one. You will catch this kind of questioning when you listen through the recording after the session, and you can avoid it the next time. Ask brief questions. We all know the irrepressible speech-maker who, when questions are called for at the end of a lecture, gets up and asks five-minute questions. It is unlikely that the narrator is so dull that it takes more than a sentence or two for her to understand the question. Start with questions that are not controversial; save the delicate questions, if there are any, until you have become better acquainted. A good place to begin is with the narrator\u2019s youth and background. Don\u2019t let periods of silence fluster you. Give your narrator a chance to think of what she wants to add before you hustle her along with the next question. Relax, write a few words on your notepad. The sure sign of a beginning interviewer is a tape where every brief pause signals the next question Don\u2019t worry if your questions are not as beautifully phrased as you would like them to be for posterity. A few fumbled questions will help put your narrator at ease as she realizes that you are not perfect and she need not worry if she isn\u2019t either. It is not necessary to practice fumbling a few questions; most of us are nervous enough to do that naturally. Don\u2019t interrupt a good story because you have thought of a question, or because your narrator is straying from the planned outline. If the information is pertinent, let her go on, but jot down your question on your notepad so you will remember to ask it later. If your narrator does stray into subjects that are not pertinent (the most common problems are to follow some family member\u2019s children or to get into a series of family medical problems), try to pull her back as quickly as possible. \u201cBefore we move on, I\u2019d like to find out how the closing of the mine in 1935 affected your family\u2019s finances. Do you remember that?\u201d It is often hard for a narrator to describe people. An easy way to begin is to ask her to describe the person\u2019s appearance. From there, the narrator is more likely to move into character description. Don\u2019t switch the recorder off and on. It is much better to waste a little tape on irrelevant material than to call attention to the tape recorder by a constant on-off operation. Of course you can turn off the recorder if the telephone rings or if someone interrupts your session. Interviews, for beginning interviewers, usually work out better if there is no one present except the narrator and the interviewer. Sometimes two or more narrators can be successfully recorded, but usually each one of them would have been better alone. End the interview at a reasonable time. An hour and a half is probably the maximum. First, you must protect your narrator against over-fatigue; second, you will be tired even if she isn\u2019t. Some narrators tell you very frankly if they are tired, or their spouses will. Otherwise, you must plead fatigue, another appointment, or no more tape. Don\u2019t use the interview to show off your knowledge, vocabulary, charm, or other abilities. Good interviewers do not shine; only their interviews do. The next few tips are more focused on oral history work, but they apply to other kinds of research as well: Try to establish at every important point in the story where the narrator was or what her role was in this event, in order to indicate how much is eye-witness information and how much based on reports of others. \u201cWhere were you at the time of the mine disaster?\u201d \u201cDid you talk to any of the survivors later?\u201d Work around these questions carefully, so that you will not appear to be doubting the accuracy of the narrator\u2019s account. Do not challenge accounts you think might be inaccurate. Instead, try to develop as much information as possible that can be used by later researchers in establishing what probably happened. Your narrator may be telling you quite accurately what she saw. As Walter Lord explained when describing his interviews with survivors of the Titanic, \u201cEvery lady I interviewed had left the sinking ship in the last lifeboat. As I later found out from studying the placement of the lifeboats, no group of lifeboats was in view of another and each lady probably was in the last lifeboat she could see leaving the ship.\u201d Try to avoid \u201coff the record\u201d information\u2014the times when your narrator asks you to turn off the recorder while she tells you a good story. Ask her to let you record the whole things and promise that you will erase that portion if she asks you to after further consideration. You may have to erase it later, or she may not tell you the story at all, but once you allow \u201coff the record\u201d stories, she may continue with more and more, and you will end up with almost no recorded interview at all. \u201cOff the record\u201d information is only useful if you yourself are researching a subject and this is the only way you can get the information. It has no value if your purpose is to collect information for later use by other researchers.","title":"Interview Tips"},{"location":"guides/interview_tips/#interview-tips","text":"Collected below are a series of notes and/or prompts to asking better questions while doing documentary/ethnographic research. It assumes the interviewer has at least a notepad in hand and, perhaps, basic recording technology. An interview is not a dialogue. The whole point of the interview is to get the narrator to tell her story. Limit your own remarks to a few pleasantries to break the ice, then brief questions to guide her along. It is not necessary to give her the details of your great-grandmother\u2019s life growing up in Abbeville in order to get her to tell you about her grandfather\u2019s trip to Texas. Just say, \u201cI understand your grandfather went to Texas during the oil boom. What did he tell you about his time there?\u201d Ask questions that require more of an answer than \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d Start with \u201cwhy,\u201d \u201chow,\u201d \u201cwhere,\u201d \u201cwhat kind of \u2026\u201d instead of \u201cWas Henry Miller a good boss?\u201d ask \u201cWhat did the drilling crew say about Henry Miller?\u201d Ask one question at a time. Sometimes interviewers ask a series of questions all at once. Probably the narrator will answer only the first or last one. You will catch this kind of questioning when you listen through the recording after the session, and you can avoid it the next time. Ask brief questions. We all know the irrepressible speech-maker who, when questions are called for at the end of a lecture, gets up and asks five-minute questions. It is unlikely that the narrator is so dull that it takes more than a sentence or two for her to understand the question. Start with questions that are not controversial; save the delicate questions, if there are any, until you have become better acquainted. A good place to begin is with the narrator\u2019s youth and background. Don\u2019t let periods of silence fluster you. Give your narrator a chance to think of what she wants to add before you hustle her along with the next question. Relax, write a few words on your notepad. The sure sign of a beginning interviewer is a tape where every brief pause signals the next question Don\u2019t worry if your questions are not as beautifully phrased as you would like them to be for posterity. A few fumbled questions will help put your narrator at ease as she realizes that you are not perfect and she need not worry if she isn\u2019t either. It is not necessary to practice fumbling a few questions; most of us are nervous enough to do that naturally. Don\u2019t interrupt a good story because you have thought of a question, or because your narrator is straying from the planned outline. If the information is pertinent, let her go on, but jot down your question on your notepad so you will remember to ask it later.

A literature review is a survey of scholarly sources on a specific topic. It provides an overview of current knowledge, allowing you to identify relevant theories, methods , and gaps in the existing research. Conducting a literature review involves collecting, evaluating and analyzing publications (such as books and journal articles) that relate to your research question . There are five main steps in the process of writing a literature review: Search for relevant literature Evaluate sources Identify themes, debates and gaps Outline the structure Write your literature review A good literature review doesn\u2019t just summarize sources \u2013 it analyzes, synthesizes , and critically evaluates to give a clear picture of the state of knowledge on the subject. Why write a literature review? When you write a thesis, dissertation , or research paper , you will have to conduct a literature review to situate your research within existing knowledge. The literature review gives you a chance to: Demonstrate your familiarity with the topic and scholarly context Develop a theoretical framework and methodology for your research Position yourself in relation to other researchers and theorists Show how your research addresses a gap or contributes to a debate You might also have to write a literature review as a stand-alone assignment. In this case, the purpose is to evaluate the current state of research and demonstrate your knowledge of scholarly debates around a topic. The content will look slightly different in each case, but the process of conducting a literature review follows the same steps. Step 1: Search for relevant literature Before you begin searching for literature, you need a clearly defined topic . If you are writing the literature review section of a dissertation or research paper, you will search for literature related to your research problem and questions . If you are writing a literature review as a stand-alone assignment, you will have to choose a focus and develop a central question to direct your search. Unlike a dissertation research question, this question has to be answerable without collecting original data. You should be able to answer it based only on a review of existing publications. Search for literature using keywords and citations Start by creating a list of keywords related to your research topic and question. Some useful databases to search for journals and articles include: Your university\u2019s library catalogue Google Scholar JSTOR EBSCO Project Muse (humanities and social sciences) Medline (life sciences and biomedicine) EconLit (economics) Inspec (physics, engineering and computer science) Read the abstract to find out whether an article is relevant to your question. When you find a useful book or article, you can check the bibliography to find other relevant sources. To identify the most important publications on your topic, take note of recurring citations. If the same authors, books or articles keep appearing in your reading, make sure to seek them out. You can find out how many times an article has been cited on Google Scholar \u2013 a high citation count means the article has been influential in the field, and should certainly be included in your literature review. Step 2: Evaluate and select sources You probably won\u2019t be able to read absolutely everything that has been written on the topic \u2013 you\u2019ll have to evaluate which sources are most relevant to your questions. For each publication, ask yourself: What question or problem is the author addressing? What are the key concepts and how are they defined? What are the key theories, models and methods? Does the research use established frameworks or take an innovative approach? What are the results and conclusions of the study? How does the publication relate to other literature in the field? Does it confirm, add to, or challenge established knowledge? How does the publication contribute to your understanding of the topic? What are its key insights and arguments? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the research? Make sure the sources you use are credible , and make sure you read any landmark studies and major theories in your field of research. The scope of your review will depend on your topic and discipline: in the sciences you usually only review recent literature, but in the humanities you might take a long historical perspective (for example, to trace how a concept has changed in meaning over time). Take notes and cite your sources As you read, you should also begin the writing process. Take notes that you can later incorporate into the text of your literature review. It is important to keep track of your sources with citations to avoid plagiarism . It can be helpful to make an annotated bibliography , where you compile full citation information and write a paragraph of summary and analysis for each source. This helps you remember what you read and saves time later in the process. My suggestion is to use a reference manager. You can use our free citation generator to quickly create correct and consistent APA citations or MLA format citations . Step 3: Identify themes, debates, and gaps To begin organizing your literature review\u2019s argument and structure, you need to understand the connections and relationships between the sources you\u2019ve read. Based on your reading and notes, you can look for: Trends and patterns (in theory, method or results): do certain approaches become more or less popular over time? Themes: what questions or concepts recur across the literature? Debates, conflicts and contradictions: where do sources disagree? Pivotal publications: are there any influential theories or studies that changed the direction of the field? Gaps: what is missing from the literature? Are there weaknesses that need to be addressed? This step will help you work out the structure of your literature review and (if applicable) show how your own research will contribute to existing knowledge. Step 4: Outline your literature review\u2019s structure There are various approaches to organizing the body of a literature review. You should have a rough idea of your strategy before you start writing. Depending on the length of your literature review, you can combine several of these strategies (for example, your overall structure might be thematic, but each theme is discussed chronologically). Chronological The simplest approach is to trace the development of the topic over time. However, if you choose this strategy, be careful to avoid simply listing and summarizing sources in order. Try to analyze patterns, turning points and key debates that have shaped the direction of the field. Give your interpretation of how and why certain developments occurred. Thematic If you have found some recurring central themes, you can organize your literature review into subsections that address different aspects of the topic. For example, if you are reviewing literature about inequalities in migrant health outcomes, key themes might include healthcare policy, language barriers, cultural attitudes, legal status, and economic access. Methodological If you draw your sources from different disciplines or fields that use a variety of research methods , you might want to compare the results and conclusions that emerge from different approaches. For example: Look at what results have emerged in qualitative versus quantitative research Discuss how the topic has been approached by empirical versus theoretical scholarship Divide the literature into sociological, historical, and cultural sources Theoretical A literature review is often the foundation for a theoretical framework . You can use it to discuss various theories, models, and definitions of key concepts. You might argue for the relevance of a specific theoretical approach, or combine various theoretical concepts to create a framework for your research. Step 5: Write your literature review Like any other academic text, your literature review should have an introduction , a main body, and a conclusion . What you include in each depends on the objective of your literature review. Introduction The introduction should clearly establish the focus and purpose of the literature review. Dissertation literature review If you are writing the literature review as part of your dissertation or thesis, reiterate your central problem or research question and give a brief summary of the scholarly context. You can emphasize the timeliness of the topic (\u201cmany recent studies have focused on the problem of x\u201d) or highlight a gap in the literature (\u201cwhile there has been much research on x, few researchers have taken y into consideration\u201d). Stand-alone literature review If you are writing a stand-alone paper, give some background on the topic and its importance, discuss the scope of the literature you will review (for example, the time period of your sources), and state your objective. What new insight will you draw from the literature? Body Depending on the length of your literature review, you might want to divide the body into subsections. You can use a subheading for each theme, time period, or methodological approach. As you write, you can follow these tips: Summarize and synthesize: give an overview of the main points of each source and combine them into a coherent whole Analyze and interpret: don\u2019t just paraphrase other researchers\u2014add your own interpretations where possible, discussing the significance of findings in relation to the literature as a whole Critically evaluate: mention the strengths and weaknesses of your sources Write in well-structured paragraphs: use transitions and topic sentences to draw connections, comparisons and contrasts Literature review paragraph example The example below is taken from the body of a literature review on the relationship between national identity and nature conservation. This paragraph discusses how humanities scholars have approached the concept of wilderness. Early work in environmental humanities tended to take a sharply critical approach to wilderness, focusing on the cultural construction of supposedly \u2018natural\u2019 landscapes. The rise of climate change awareness in the 1980s had been framed by narratives about \u201cthe end of nature\u201d (McKibben 1989), in which a once-pristine wilderness is degraded by humans to the point of disappearance. In response to this popular discourse, environmental historian William Cronon critiqued the concept of a pure, pristine nature to be preserved from human influence, arguing that ideas like \u201cwilderness\u201d are themselves products of particular human cultures and histories. In his influential essay \u2018The Trouble with Wilderness\u2019 (1995), Cronon traces how the ideal of untouched wilderness, anxiety over its loss, and the political will to preserve it has been central to American national identity, entwined with religious motifs and colonial frontier mythologies. Following Cronon, the racial and class politics of wilderness preservation was a theme taken up by several scholars in the late 1990s and early 2000s, who researched the material effects of conservation politics on indigenous and rural Americans (Catton 1997; Spence 1999; Jacoby 2001). The US National Park system became the dominant paradigm for analyzing relations between conservation, nationhood and nationalism. However, this approach has sometimes led to a narrowly US-centric perspective that fails to engage closely with the meanings and materialities of \u201cwilderness\u201d in different contexts. Recent work has begun to challenge this paradigm and argue for more varied approaches to understanding the socio-political relations between nation and nature. The example combines the thematic and chronological approaches. This section of the literature review focuses on the theme of wilderness, while the paragraph itself is organized chronologically. Conclusion In the conclusion, you should summarize the key findings you have taken from the literature and emphasize their significance. Dissertation literature review If the literature review is part of your thesis or dissertation, show how your research addresses gaps and contributes new knowledge, or discuss how you have drawn on existing theories and methods to build a framework for your research. Stand-alone literature review If you are writing a stand-alone paper, you can discuss the overall implications of the literature or make suggestions for future research based on the gaps you have identified. When you\u2019ve finished writing and revising your literature review, don\u2019t forget to proofread thoroughly before submitting.","title":"How to write a literature review"},{"location":"guides/lit_review/#how-to-write-a-literature-review","text":"This guide is adapted from Shona McCombes \u2018 published on Scribbr.

With that notepad or portfolio in your bag, you go from class to class, meeting to meeting, event to event, and you take notes.

Other kinds of \u201ctexts\u201d are not off-limits, but they do, in having different dimensions, present different issues when it comes to data capture. While we must recognize that there is more to any text than simply its words and the vocal medium in which it is conveyed \u2013 that is, the linguistic and paralinguistic dimensions of a spoken text \u2013 it is also the case that written texts and audio recordings are much smaller in size than video recordings, and much easier to handle as a result, thus much of this particular guide is focused on audio software and hardware. Software For most of us, the voice memo app that comes with most smart phones will do the trick, so long as your clear on how to get recordings off the device: in most instances, it should be fairly easy to email the recording to yourself, or, in the case of the Voice Memos app in iOS, to sync them to off-device storage. (iOS\u2019s Voice Memos will sync audio files to the Notes application, for example, which you should then be able to open on your Mac, provided you have a Mac and you have signed up for their iCloud service.) There are a lot of other sound recording apps available for smart phones. I have used a few, including both FiRe (Field Recorder) and CaptureAudio. I use the latter more often these days, but both are fine. I prefer to use dedicated audio recording apps because they allow you to choose the format in which you record your audio. Like almost all digital media formats, audio recordings come in both uncompressed, or \u201craw\u201d, and compressed forms. Most of you are familiar with, and indeed rely upon, a compressed format known as MP3. For my own fieldwork, when it is my research (and my reputation) on the line, I use an uncompressed format known as AIFF. See the note about CODECS below. Hardware Some of you may own and use, or have a friend or family member who uses, a dedicated camera, either a point and shoot or what is known as a DSLR. You are thus familiar with the idea that while the audio capture capabilities of your smart phone is \u201cgood enough\u201d for most purposes, it is not terribly good at it in particular. There are a couple of ways to improve this situation, and they involve purchasing additional equipment (or hardware). Microphones The simplest, and least expensive, option to enhance your audio recording capabilities is to purchase a microphone: almost any external microphone will be better than the one built into your smart phone, which, to be honest, wasn\u2019t chosen for the quality of its audio capture so much as its ability to fit into the small case of your phone and that it didn\u2019t cost very much. Please be careful when buying a microphone to purchase the appropriate cable that will link it to your device. Most professional recording equipment uses a grounded connection known as XLR, which is a three-prong connector. Most consumer devices, especially small devices, use an eighth-inch or \u201cmini\u201d jack with a TRS (Tip-Ring-Sleeve) or TRRS (Tip-Ring-Ring-Sleeve) arrangement for stereo audio input and output. (And do be aware that an XLR to mini-jack cable loses its grounded nature, which means that other electrical fields in an environment can affect your recording.) Recorders Moving away from using your smart phone, the next step you can take is to invest in a separate device. I generally advise against this for a couple of reasons: mostly because with a good microphone and a good audio recording application, your smart phone or tablet or computer is an awfully good portable sound studio and one you already own. (So, something you already own is good, and, perhaps just as importantly, something you already carry around.) For some, however, a separate device is preferable. Perhaps your phone is really old, or maybe it\u2019s already crammed full of data and apps \u2013 remember, using any device to capture data means you are going to increase your storage needs. Or perhaps you would just have a separate device to do this kind of thing. If that\u2019s the case, then I have a couple of suggestions to make. Let me begin with the device that I use, an Roland R-09 recorder, which is no longer available, but the Roland R-05 is, and it is cheaper and better than the R-09. Both units have built-in microphones that are better than most smart phones, and they are both lightweight and dependable. They both also use widely available standard batteries (2 AA) and SD cards. You can plug an external microphone, and you can also attach either device directly to your computer for transferring files via a USB mini cable. Smaller in size, and in price, than the Roland units and also widely popular is the TASCAM DR-05 . The TASCAM DR-05 gives you much the same functionality and flexibility. Most people I know who use one don\u2019t even bother to use a microphone, but the unit does accept one. Both of these devices make it dead simple, thanks to their removable media, to move your audio recordings from the device itself to your computer. That\u2019s an important feature. Less expensive devices can sometimes make this more difficult. Here\u2019s a quick summary of other options: The Olympus voice recorders, like the Olympus VN-2700 for example, are very inexpensive and work well \u2013 but you must remember to turn off voice activation! \u2013 but getting the recordings off the device requires some work on the user\u2019s part. (And it\u2019s not a digital transfer but a matter of playing the audio into the computer.) The SONY ICD PX333 Digital Voice Recorder uses AAA batteries and removable media, but it only records in mono MP3 format. (That\u2019s an allowable option for this class, and for voice recording in general, but it is a limitation, and the Sony is a little more expensive.) The iGearPro Voice Activated Audio Recorder does allow you to turn the voice activation off, and it also allows you to connect the device directly to your computer in order to transfer files from the device. I have never used the MaxPro-Best USB Flash Drive Voice Recorder but it looks dead simple and it\u2019s very inexpensive.","title":"Recording Hardware and Software"},{"location":"guides/recording/#recording-gear","text":"Because this is a class within a literature department, we are focused mostly on verbal texts.

Do not hesitate to search for a particular problem if you can name it. What follows here is a compilation of the basics that I have found most useful in working with students who are, in turn, working on their writing. Use what\u2019s useful. Ignore the rest. Overview While the subjects you encounter in my classes may be literature or folklore or even just raw data, my goal is to teach you to gather data into information and to process information into knowledge. And then to communicate that knowledge to others. In most cases, writing is part of the process or the end result of the process, the product. Speaking of products, here are some examples: Underlying this video essay on \u201cWall-E as Sociological Storytelling\u201d , which is a terrible title, is good writing: the writer here both knows how to pace things in relationship to the video but also calls upon scholarly sources to substantiate his exploration. Building Blocks For those who need a brief (and very user-friendly) refresher on the parts of speech, there\u2019s always this graphic . As a reader who also writes, I come across a fair amount of material on the web, some of which strikes me as useful to share with others. For example, in this Medium post , Josh Spector gives you five things to do to make your writing better. I agree with most of them, except for the one about shorter sentences and shorter paragraphs \u2013 my advice there is to vary the length of both. Sentences Types of Clauses Sentences are made up of words, phrases, and clauses, going from smallest to largest units. Knowing the types of clauses that make up sentences is foundational to understanding the types of sentences. Please note that I am not introducing the oft-used definition of a sentence as a complete thought\u2014I have never been entirely clear on what that meant. An independent clause ( IC ) is a group of words that contains a subject and verb. An independent clause is a sentence, usually a simple sentence. A dependent clause ( DC ) is a group of words that contain a subject and verb but cannot stand on its own: a dependent clause cannot be a sentence. Unwitting dependent clauses are usually considered fragments, but carefully constructed ones can be used for some rhetorical purposes. A dependent marker word ( DM ) is a word added to the beginning of an independent clause that turns it into a dependent clause. Some common DMs are: after, although, as, as if, because, before, even if, even though, in order to, since, though, unless, until, whatever, when, whenever, whether, while, that, which, what, who whoever, whom, whomever, and whose. Types of Sentences All sentences must have at least one independent clause, but beyond that you can build just about anything you want, with the only risk being a Frankensentence that your reader has to read too many times to understand\u2014but that shouldn\u2019t stop you from trying to create interesting sentences that represent the complexity of the topic at hand. Simple Sentences have one main clause (IC) with a subject and verb, either of which can be compound. e.g., I studied. Lily and Madeline studied. Lily read and studied. Lily and Madeline played music and studied. Compound Sentences consist of at least two main clauses (IC) joined with a coordinating conjunction, a semi-colon, or a colon. Complex Sentences have one main clause (IC) and at least one subordinate clause (DC)\u2014note the difference between coordination and subordination. Compound-Complex Sentences have two more main clauses (IC) and at least one subordinate clause (DC). That\u2019s it. Thats all the sentence types there are. Every sentence you make will be one of these. Paragraphs A Step-by-Step Guide to Writing a Paragraph in an Analytical Work Writing well composed paragraphs that move an analysis forward can be tricky. The following is a guide on how to draft, expand, refine, and explain your ideas so that you write clear, well-developed paragraphs and discussion posts. Step 1: Decide the Topic of Your Paragraph Before you can begin writing, you need to know what you are writing about. If you are writing from a prompt, this should be straightforward: look at the writing prompt or assignment topic and note any key terms or repeated phrases and use those words in your response. Writing from a self-generated topic can be a little more difficult, but in the end you need to find ways to break your point into topics and then to remain on topic within a given paragraph: On what topic am I supposed to be writing? What do I know about this topic already? If I don\u2019t know how to respond to this topic, where can I go to find some answers? What does this topic mean to me? How do I relate to it? Step 2: Develop a Topic Sentence Before writing a paragraph, it is important to think first about the topic and then what you want to say about the topic. Most often, the topic is easy, but the question then turns to what you want to say about the topic. This concept is sometimes called the controlling idea. Strong paragraphs are typically about one main idea or topic, which is often explicitly stated in a topic sentence. Good topic sentences should always contain both (1) a topic and (2) a controlling idea. The topic is the main subject matter or idea covered in the paragraph. The controlling idea focuses the topic by providing direction to the composition. Read the following topic sentences. They all contain a topic (in bold) and a controlling idea (in italics). When your paragraphs contain a clearly stated topic sentence such as one of the following, your reader will know what to expect and, therefore, understand your ideas better. Examples of topic sentences: People can avoid plagiarizing by taking certain precautions . There are several advantages to online education . Effective leadership requires specific qualities that anyone can develop . Step 3: Demonstrate Your Point After stating your topic sentence, you need to provide information to prove, illustrate, clarify, and/or exemplify your point. Ask yourself: What examples can I use to support my point? What information can I provide to help clarify my thoughts? How can I support my point with specific data, experiences, or other factual material? What information does the reader need to know in order to see my point? Here is a list of the kinds of information you can add to your paragraph: Facts, details, reasons, examples Information from the readings or class discussions Paraphrases or short quotations Statistics, polls, percentages, data from research studies Personal experience, stories, anecdotes, examples from your life Sometimes, adding transitional or introductory phrases like: for example, for instance, first, second, or last can help guide the reader. Also, make sure you are citing your sources appropriately. Step 4: Give Your Paragraph Meaning After you have given the reader enough information to see and understand your point, you need to explain why this information is relevant, meaningful, or interesting. Ask yourself: What does the provided information mean? How does it relate to your overall point, argument, or thesis? Why is this information important/significant/meaningful? How does this information relate to the assignment or course I am taking? Step 5: Conclude After illustrating your point with relevant information, add a concluding sentence. Concluding sentences link one paragraph to the next and provide another device for helping you ensure your paragraph is unified. While not all paragraphs include a concluding sentence, you should always consider whether one is appropriate. Concluding sentences have two crucial roles in paragraph writing: First, they draw together the information you have presented to elaborate your controlling idea by: Summarizing the point(s) you have made. Repeating words or phrases from the topic sentence. Using linking words that indicate that conclusions are being drawn (e.g., therefore, thus, resulting). Second, they often link the current paragraph to the following paragraph. They may anticipate the topic sentence of the next paragraph by: Introducing a word/phrase or new concept which will then be picked up in the topic sentence of the next paragraph. Using words or phrases that point ahead (e.g., the following, another, other). Step 6: Read and Revise The last step in good paragraph writing is proofreading and revision. Before you submit your writing, look over your work at least one more time. Try reading your paragraph outloud to make sure it makes sense. Also, ask yourself these questions: Does my paragraph answer the prompt and support my thesis? Does it make sense? Does it use the appropriate academic voice? Paragraph Says/Does There are a variety of ways to take texts apart, to analyze them, in order to understand how the parts fit together. A good summary must represent all the parts of a text. In a non-fiction text, like a work of scholarship or science, you want to look closely at each paragraph to understand how the author is building his/her argument. Think of each paragraph as a stepping stone through a large field: there are possibly a number of ways to get from where you start to where you end, but the author has chosen this particular path. The path is nothing more than each step the text takes and a paragraph, for the time being is a step. Nota bene : We can do the same for sentences within a paragraph, but that kind of \u201czoomed-in\u201d analysis we will do elsewhere. For now, we will stay at a slightly higher level, \u201czoomed out\u201d if you will \u2013 this scaling, zooming in and out, of analysis is very useful for compartmentalizing the work we do in analysis. The easiest way to do a says/does analysis is to make the process simple and clear: Draw a vertical line down the middle of a piece of paper \u2013 or make a table in a word processing document \u2013 creating two columns. On the left is the says column; on the right, does . Write a phrase of sentence in the left column to summarize the key point of the paragraph. On the right, describe what the paragraph does for the reader: introduce a new point, expand the point of the previous paragraph, describe a particular moment, provide some historical background. The does descriptor cannot mention any content in the paragraph. Usually when I do this in a course, I will divide people into groups and have each group work with a chunk of paragraphs. We then assemble a summary, using the lefthand entries as the content and the righthand entries as means to weigh their importance. More importantly, writers can use this method of analyzing texts to assess their own: be clear on what each paragraph is doing, because if the writer isn\u2019t clear, the reader certainly won\u2019t be. Examples \u00b6 SAYS DOES 1 That the writer is going to the laundry room and will be there for a while. Sets the scene both physically or emotionally. 2 that the writer puts clothes in the washing machine and thinks about her boyfriend prepares the reader for alternate description of activities and reflection 3 that the writer would like to be swept offer her feet by someone rich and handsome makes a bit of fun of the writer\u2019s reflections; shows that she doesn\u2019t take herself too seriously 4 the writer continues with doing what she has to do to get the laundry done but is interrupted (and embarrassed) by someone she doesn\u2019t like and by someone who gives her a chalce to reflect amusingly on male behavior describes the actual world the writer is in and shows how she reacts to it Introductory Paragraphs Defining a Term In his introduction to his essay on \u201cTradition,\u201d Henry Glassie establishes that defining a term need not term to external source but can be conjured out of what he and his audience already know and believe to be neccesarily true: Accept, to begin, that tradition is the creation of the future out of the past. A continuous process situated in the nothingness of the present, linking the vanished with the unknown, tradition is stopped, parceled, and codified by thinkers who fix upon this aspect or that, in accord with their needs or preoccupations, and leave us with a scatter of apparently contradictory, yet cogent, definitions. More important, I believe, than erecting and polishing a new definition, which would but stand as a monument to the worries of our unmemorable era, is developing an understanding of the concept in the breadth of its semantic extent. Widening into an embrace of the many ways people convert the old into the new, tradition spreads into association with adjacent, related, equally indispensable terms. Our understanding begins as we refine tradition in conjunction with history and culture. (Glassie 1995: 395) Richard Bauman does not define a term in the introduction to his essay on \u201cThe La Have Island General Store.\u201d Instead he discusses its current usage and how it might warrant expansion. He also, like Robinson does, uses a pas de deux approach and saves the articulation of his focus for the second paragraph. ONE OF THE ROCKS on which the ethnography of speaking is built is that the role of speaking in culture and society is cross-culturally variable and diverse. For some peoples, speaking will be the focus of a high degree of interest, elaboration, and evaluation, while in other groups it will receive relatively little conscious attention. A major part of our collective ethnographic task is to establish the full range of variability in this sphere. Despite this charter, however, there has been a clear bias in our work toward the groups in which speaking is a cultural focus; either we become interested in the ethnography of speaking because language turns out to be quite important in a group we are working on, or we make our choices of groups in which to do ethnographies of speaking on the basis of the apparent importance of speaking in their culture because time for research is be- coming ever more precious. Certainly both sets of factors have entered into my own decisions to work on the Quakers and the Vincentians. To be sure, we do have a few glimpses of the other side of the coin, as in Peter Gardner\u2019s description of the Paliyans, for example,\u2019 but note how often this case must be cited as the one example of a group with a minimal and negative concern for language because we have no others.2 If we are to avoid skewing the still de- veloping field of inquiry in which we are engaged, we need to start bringing in accounts of more sociolinguistically modest groups together with their more talkative brethren, with a view toward the larger goal of constructing typologies of the role of speaking in culture and society. My own introductory paragraph, like Glassie\u2019s above, seeks to suggest an intellectual history for a term: \u201cTalking shit\u201d is a venerable tradition in many African American speech communities. As an umbrella term, it typically covers only a particular portfolio of genres, both in day-to-day as well as in analytical uses. In performance, individual speakers deploy forms that are largely made up of reported speech, reflecting an understanding of authorship as diffused in the space of the fictive present as well as across performances reaching back to the historical past. A close examination of the forms involved in fact reveals that not only are texts generated, variously, in dialogue but that they are constructed of dialogue as well, creating a continuum across semantic and pragmatic domains which speakers use to great effect. This study, located in a small south Louisiana town, highlights the flexible nature of the genres involved, allowing speakers to move into and out of the performance frame, which is itself sometimes considered a dimension of the performance. Sketching a Scene Dropping your reader into the middle of a scene that dramatizes some aspect of what you are about to analyze is another way to write an introduction. Consider the following scenario: Three months or so before the release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, a reader gets online, locates Amazon. com, and, typing in the title of the seventh novel, pulls up the exact timing of its release (July 21, 2007), the package deals featuring the first six Potter novels, as well as industry and customer buzz about the series\u2019 final installment. Having logged on seeking specific information about Hallows, our reader is pleasantly surprised to discover that Amazon has already done much of the looking for her and has placed its results at the Harry Potter Store, one of only two stores on the site devoted to a single series.1 There, just a click away from Amazon\u2019s home page, she finds that the novels reside alongside the site\u2019s own version of Pottermania\u2014trivia quizzes, film updates and interviews, an ever-increasing stock of paraphernalia, testimonials, message board discussions, and blog accounts. There, too, she learns that the store acts as a kind of Potter impresario, sponsoring special features from Kid Correspondents, to the Owl Delivery Writing Adventure, to the Harry-est Town in America.2 Before she leaves the site, our reader bookmarks the Harry Potter Store. She plans on returning. (Wu 2010: 190) Some years ago, I found myself touring the city of Cincinnati with a friend and as we drove through one particular neighborhood she identi\u00adfied it in a twofold fashion: it was a \u201chillbilly\u201d neighborhood and it was dangerous \u2013 one being the product of another. While I was dismayed by my friend\u2019s characterization, since she was a recent transplant to the city herself, I understood her remark to be drawn from received wisdom, a term used loosely in this context. What intrigued me more as a student of material culture and vernacular architecture was what I actually saw: significantly different uses of urban spaces. I wanted to find out for my\u00adself what was going on, and so at my first opportunity I began doing fieldwork in which a series of encounters led me to Charlie Kraft, a self\u00ad-identified urban Appalachian.

Summaries While you may view summaries as exercises performed strictly for the satisfaction of your instructor, the fact is that summaries are singularly useful reports that you write to yourself. You write a summary of a text so that you don\u2019t have to read a text again later, when you are either being examined or when you are writing your own analysis. Some things to keep in mind as you write a summary: Be clear on the purpose for the summary: what do you need it to do? As you read, or better re-read, mark sentences that seem to present the \u201cbig picture\u201d or the \u201cgist\u201d or \u201cthe point.\u201d What are the text\u2019s main ideas? Sometimes, oh sometimes, the text does not necessarily make its main ideas clear: you will have to extrapolate. The good news is that such extrapolations will necessarily be in your own words, i.e. paraphrased. Analyze the part of the text in relation to the whole \u2013 when it comes to non-fiction texts, says-does analyses can be useful here. (See \u00a7 Says-Does above.) Be sure your assessment of what is important is what the text itself is signaling as important. (And if the text says one thing and does another, that is worth describing.) Just as importantly, sometimes what\u2019s important to you is different from what is important to the text. Be sure to note your own takeaways . Be objective! Injecting your opinion is not useful to you later. A summary is a report that attempts to be as true to the original text as possible. Thesis Statements Most readers of essays look for a one or two-sentence condensation of the argument or analysis early in the text: first, because they want to know in what they are about to invest their time, and, second, they want a clear idea of the perspective or line of inquiry or argument the essay is going to pursue so that they can evaluate the text for its own consistency as well as understand how it relates to their own point of view or sensibility. From a writer\u2019s point of view, such a condensation, aka a thesis statement, allows you distill your ideas down, forcing you to clarify for yourself what your essay is about. It also allows you to better organize your text. In general, a thesis statement will accomplish these goals, of both readers and writers, if it answers a question that: tackles a subject upon which reasonable people could disagree, deals with a subject that can be adequately treated within the scope of the essay, can be expressed as a single idea\u2014though you can think of this idea as being a main clause within a complex sentence that has subordinate ideas attached to it, allows the possibility for a conclusion to be proffered. Use these four points not only to develop a thesis statement but also to test it. As you work, you will find that an iterative process includes the following steps: You begin with a topic , which can often be described with a sentence fragment: e.g., artificial intelligence. Then you narrow the topic into a hypothesis , which still might rather fragmentary: e.g., growth of artificial intelligence industries. Such a simple narrowing, by expanding the number of qualifications reduces the number of possibilities. We\u2019re not talking about AI in general but AI as an industry, and an emergent or expanding industry at that. Then you take a position and offer your reader a thesis . This can be simple, like \u201cThe growth of the artificial intelligence industries threatens humanity\u201d, or it can be something more complex, \u201cWith the growth of artificial intelligence industries, many white collar jobs could be automated in the near future.\u201d But notice how the simpler thesis is actually weaker than the more complex one. What\u2019s the difference? Specificity. The simpler thesis doesn\u2019t tell us how the growth of AI industries threaten humanity. How would you revise it to make it more specific? Stronger thesis statements: take some sort of stand: they offer a position from which to understand the subject being discussed; justify discussion\u2013e.g., \u201cMy family is an extended family.\u201d versus \u201cWhile most American families would view consanguineal marriage as a threat to the nuclear family structure, many Iranian families, like my own, believe these marriages help reinforce kinship ties in an extended family.\u201d; express one main idea, avoiding having readers confused about what they are about; are specific, making it clear what the essay will be about and making it easy for you as a writer to guarantee that the topic and scope are manageable.","title":"A (Kind of) Writing Handbook"},{"location":"guides/writing/#a-kind-of-writing-handbook","text":"The handbooks and guides available to help a writer struggling with one facet or another of writing are almost innumerable at this point.

Please note that I am not introducing the oft-used definition of a sentence as a complete thought\u2014I have never been entirely clear on what that meant. An independent clause ( IC ) is a group of words that contains a subject and verb. An independent clause is a sentence, usually a simple sentence. A dependent clause ( DC ) is a group of words that contain a subject and verb but cannot stand on its own: a dependent clause cannot be a sentence. Unwitting dependent clauses are usually considered fragments, but carefully constructed ones can be used for some rhetorical purposes. A dependent marker word ( DM ) is a word added to the beginning of an independent clause that turns it into a dependent clause. Some common DMs are: after, although, as, as if, because, before, even if, even though, in order to, since, though, unless, until, whatever, when, whenever, whether, while, that, which, what, who whoever, whom, whomever, and whose.","title":"Types of Clauses"},{"location":"guides/writing/#types-of-sentences","text":"All sentences must have at least one independent clause, but beyond that you can build just about anything you want, with the only risk being a Frankensentence that your reader has to read too many times to understand\u2014but that shouldn\u2019t stop you from trying to create interesting sentences that represent the complexity of the topic at hand. Simple Sentences have one main clause (IC) with a subject and verb, either of which can be compound. e.g., I studied. Lily and Madeline studied. Lily read and studied. Lily and Madeline played music and studied. Compound Sentences consist of at least two main clauses (IC) joined with a coordinating conjunction, a semi-colon, or a colon. Complex Sentences have one main clause (IC) and at least one subordinate clause (DC)\u2014note the difference between coordination and subordination. Compound-Complex Sentences have two more main clauses (IC) and at least one subordinate clause (DC). That\u2019s it. Thats all the sentence types there are.

Strong paragraphs are typically about one main idea or topic, which is often explicitly stated in a topic sentence. Good topic sentences should always contain both (1) a topic and (2) a controlling idea. The topic is the main subject matter or idea covered in the paragraph. The controlling idea focuses the topic by providing direction to the composition. Read the following topic sentences. They all contain a topic (in bold) and a controlling idea (in italics). When your paragraphs contain a clearly stated topic sentence such as one of the following, your reader will know what to expect and, therefore, understand your ideas better.

Second, they often link the current paragraph to the following paragraph.

A good summary must represent all the parts of a text. In a non-fiction text, like a work of scholarship or science, you want to look closely at each paragraph to understand how the author is building his/her argument. Think of each paragraph as a stepping stone through a large field: there are possibly a number of ways to get from where you start to where you end, but the author has chosen this particular path. The path is nothing more than each step the text takes and a paragraph, for the time being is a step. Nota bene : We can do the same for sentences within a paragraph, but that kind of \u201czoomed-in\u201d analysis we will do elsewhere. For now, we will stay at a slightly higher level, \u201czoomed out\u201d if you will \u2013 this scaling, zooming in and out, of analysis is very useful for compartmentalizing the work we do in analysis. The easiest way to do a says/does analysis is to make the process simple and clear: Draw a vertical line down the middle of a piece of paper \u2013 or make a table in a word processing document \u2013 creating two columns. On the left is the says column; on the right, does . Write a phrase of sentence in the left column to summarize the key point of the paragraph. On the right, describe what the paragraph does for the reader: introduce a new point, expand the point of the previous paragraph, describe a particular moment, provide some historical background. The does descriptor cannot mention any content in the paragraph. Usually when I do this in a course, I will divide people into groups and have each group work with a chunk of paragraphs. We then assemble a summary, using the lefthand entries as the content and the righthand entries as means to weigh their importance.

A summary is a report that attempts to be as true to the original text as possible.","title":"Summaries"},{"location":"guides/writing/#thesis-statements","text":"Most readers of essays look for a one or two-sentence condensation of the argument or analysis early in the text: first, because they want to know in what they are about to invest their time, and, second, they want a clear idea of the perspective or line of inquiry or argument the essay is going to pursue so that they can evaluate the text for its own consistency as well as understand how it relates to their own point of view or sensibility. From a writer\u2019s point of view, such a condensation, aka a thesis statement, allows you distill your ideas down, forcing you to clarify for yourself what your essay is about. It also allows you to better organize your text. In general, a thesis statement will accomplish these goals, of both readers and writers, if it answers a question that: tackles a subject upon which reasonable people could disagree, deals with a subject that can be adequately treated within the scope of the essay, can be expressed as a single idea\u2014though you can think of this idea as being a main clause within a complex sentence that has subordinate ideas attached to it, allows the possibility for a conclusion to be proffered. Use these four points not only to develop a thesis statement but also to test it. As you work, you will find that an iterative process includes the following steps: You begin with a topic , which can often be described with a sentence fragment: e.g., artificial intelligence. Then you narrow the topic into a hypothesis , which still might rather fragmentary: e.g., growth of artificial intelligence industries. Such a simple narrowing, by expanding the number of qualifications reduces the number of possibilities. We\u2019re not talking about AI in general but AI as an industry, and an emergent or expanding industry at that. Then you take a position and offer your reader a thesis . This can be simple, like \u201cThe growth of the artificial intelligence industries threatens humanity\u201d, or it can be something more complex, \u201cWith the growth of artificial intelligence industries, many white collar jobs could be automated in the near future.\u201d But notice how the simpler thesis is actually weaker than the more complex one. What\u2019s the difference? Specificity. The simpler thesis doesn\u2019t tell us how the growth of AI industries threaten humanity. How would you revise it to make it more specific? Stronger thesis statements: take some sort of stand: they offer a position from which to understand the subject being discussed; justify discussion\u2013e.g., \u201cMy family is an extended family.\u201d versus \u201cWhile most American families would view consanguineal marriage as a threat to the nuclear family structure, many Iranian families, like my own, believe these marriages help reinforce kinship ties in an extended family.\u201d; express one main idea, avoiding having readers confused about what they are about; are specific, making it clear what the essay will be about and making it easy for you as a writer to guarantee that the topic and scope are manageable.","title":"Thesis Statements"},{"location":"texts/grimms_91/","text":"There was once upon a time a rich King who had three daughters, who daily went to walk in the palace garden, and the King was a great lover of all kinds of fine trees, but there was one for which he had such an affection, that if anyone gathered an apple from it he wished him a hundred fathoms underground. And when harvest time came, the apples on this tree were all as red as blood. The three daughters went every day beneath the tree, and looked to see if the wind had not blown down an apple, but they never by any chance found one, and the tree was so loaded with them that it was almost breaking, and the branches hung down to the ground. Then the King\u2019s youngest child had a great desire for an apple, and said to her sisters, \u201cOur father loves us far too much to wish us underground, it is my belief that he would only do that to people who were strangers.\u201d And while she was speaking, the child plucked off quite a large apple, and ran to her sisters, saying, \u201cJust taste, my dear little sisters, for never in my life have I tasted anything so delightful.\u201d Then the two other sisters also ate some of the apple, whereupon all three sank deep down into the earth, where they could hear no cock crow. When mid-day came, the King wished to call them to come to dinner, but they were nowhere to be found. He sought them everywhere in the palace and garden, but could not find them. Then he was much troubled, and made known to the whole land that whosoever brought his daughters back again should have one of them to wife. Hereupon so many young men went about the country in search, that there was no counting them, for every one loved the three children because they were so kind to all, and so fair of face. Three young huntsmen also went out, and when they had travelled about for eight days, they arrived at a great castle, in which were beautiful apartments, and in one room a table was laid on which were delicate dishes which were still so warm that they were smoking, but in the whole of the castle no human being was either to be seen or heard. They waited there for half a day, and the food still remained warm and smoking, and at length they were so hungry that they sat down and ate, and agreed with each other that they would stay and live in that castle, and that one of them, who should be chosen by casting lots, should remain in the house, and the two others seek the King\u2019s daughters. They cast lots, and the lot fell on the eldest; so next day the two younger went out to seek, and the eldest had to stay home. At mid-day came a small, small mannikin and begged for a piece of bread, then the huntsman took the bread which he had found there, and cut a round off the loaf and was about to give it to him, but whilst he was giving it to the mannikin, the latter let it fall, and asked the huntsman to be so good as to give him that piece again. The huntsman was about to do so and stooped, on which the mannikin took a stick, seized him by the hair, and gave him a good beating. Next day, the second stayed at home, and he fared no better. When the two others returned in the evening, the eldest said, \u201cWell, how have you got on?\u201d \u201cOh, very badly,\u201d said he, and then they lamented their misfortune together, but they said nothing about it to the youngest, for they did not like him at all, and always called him Stupid Hans, because he did not exactly belong to the forest. On the third day, the youngest stayed at home, and again the little mannikin came and begged for a piece of bread. When the youth gave it to him, the elf let it fall as before, and asked him to be so good as to give him that piece again. Then said Hans to the little mannikin, \u201cWhat! canst thou not pick up that piece thyself? If thou wilt not take as much trouble as that for thy daily bread, thou dost not deserve to have it.\u201d Then the mannikin grew very angry and said he was to do it, but the huntsman would not, and took my dear mannikin, and gave him a thorough beating. Then the mannikin screamed terribly, and cried, \u201cStop, stop, and let me go, and I will tell thee where the King\u2019s daughters are.\u201d When Hans heard that, he left off beating him and the mannikin told him that he was an earth mannikin, and that there were more than a thousand like him, and that if he would go with him he would show him where the King\u2019s daughters were. Then he showed him a deep well, but there was no water in it. And the elf said that he knew well that the companions Hans had with him did not intend to deal honourably with him, therefore if he wished to deliver the King\u2019s children, he must do it alone. The two other brothers would also be very glad to recover the King\u2019s daughters, but they did not want to have any trouble or danger. Hans was therefore to take a large basket, and he must seat himself in it with his hanger and a bell, and be let down. Below were three rooms, and in each of them was a princess, with a many-headed dragon, whose heads she was to comb and trim, but he must cut them off. And having said all this, the elf vanished. When it was evening the two brothers came and asked how he had got on, and he said, \u201cpretty well so far,\u201d and that he had seen no one except at mid-day when a little mannikin had come and begged for a piece of bread, that he had given some to him, but that the mannikin had let it fall and had asked him to pick it up again; but as he did not choose to do that, the elf had begun to lose his temper, and that he had done what he ought not, and had given the elf a beating, on which he had told him where the King\u2019s daughters were. Then the two were so angry at this that they grew green and yellow. Next morning they went to the well together, and drew lots who should first seat himself in the basket, and again the lot fell on the eldest, and he was to seat himself in it, and take the bell with him. Then he said, \u201cIf I ring, you must draw me up again immediately.\u201d When he had gone down for a short distance, he rang, and they at once drew him up again. Then the second seated himself in the basket, but he did just the same as the first, and then it was the turn of the youngest, but he let himself be lowered quite to the bottom. When he had got out of the basket, he took his hanger, and went and stood outside the first door and listened, and heard the dragon snoring quite loudly. He opened the door slowly, and one of the princesses was sitting there, and had nine dragon\u2019s heads lying upon her lap, and was combing them. Then he took his hanger and hewed at them, and the nine fell off. The princess sprang up, threw her arms round his neck, embraced and kissed him repeatedly, and took her stomacher, which was made of pure gold, and hung it round his neck. Then he went to the second princess, who had a dragon with five heads to comb, and delivered her also, and to the youngest, who had a dragon with four heads, he went likewise. And they all rejoiced, and embraced him and kissed him without stopping. Then he rang very loud, so that those above heard him, and he placed the princesses one after the other in the basket, and had them all drawn up, but when it came to his own turn he remembered the words of the elf, who had told him that his comrades did not mean well by him. So he took a great stone which was lying there, and placed it in the basket, and when it was about half way up, his false brothers above cut the rope, so that the basket with the stone fell to the ground, and they thought that he was dead, and ran away with the three princesses, making them promise to tell their father that it was they who had delivered them, and then they went to the King, and each demanded a princess in marriage. In the meantime the youngest huntsman was wandering about the three chambers in great trouble, fully expecting to have to end his days there, when he saw, hanging on the wall, a flute; then said he, \u201cWhy dost thou hang there, no one can be merry here?\u201d He looked at the dragons, heads likewise and said, \u201cYou too cannot help me now.\u201d He walked backwards and forwards for such a long time that he made the surface of the ground quite smooth. But at last other thoughts came to his mind, and he took the flute from the wall, and played a few notes on it, and suddenly a number of elves appeared, and with every note that he sounded one more came. Then he played until the room was entirely filled. They all asked what he desired, so he said he wished to get above ground back to daylight, on which they seized him by every hair that grew on his head, and thus they flew with him onto the earth again. When he was above ground, he at once went to the King\u2019s palace, just as the wedding of one princess was about to be celebrated, and he went to the room where the King and his three daughters were. When the princesses saw him they fainted. Hereupon the King was angry, and ordered him to be put in prison at once, because he thought he must have done some injury to the children. When the princesses came to themselves, however, they entreated the King to set him free again. The King asked why, and they said that they were not allowed to tell that, but their father said that they were to tell it to the stove. And he went out, listened at the door, and heard everything. Then he caused the two brothers to be hanged on the gallows, and to the third he gave his youngest daughter, and on that occasion I wore a pair of glass shoes, and I struck them against a stone, and they said, \u201cKlink,\u201d and were broken.","title":"Grimms 91"},{"location":"texts/hicks_2/","text":"This one is about Jack and Tom and Will\u2014of old Fire Dragon that spit balls of fire. And Jack\u2019s dad had a great bug track of land, owned it. So, he give it to Jack and Tom and Will to clear; give \u2018em the land and made \u2018em a deed for it, to clear and start clearing it theirselves. And so, they got up a wagon-load of vittles and went where it was at and built \u2018em a \u2026notched \u2018em up a shanty to stay in. And so, they knowed that the next\u2026that, when they got ready to clear it, that they\u2019d have to leave, uh, leave one till twelve (and he could help, then, after twelve) to cook dinner. So they left Will the first time. And Jack and Tom cleared, and Will got dinner and rung the dinner\u2026blowed the dinner horn. And, just when he blowed it, up out of a holler come old Fire Dragon, up with his pipe in his mouth, and come in at the door. And just come on in. And Will had the dinner set on the table, and he come in and never said a word to Will. And Will was so scared he hid behind the door. And Fire Dragon eat every bite, sopped the dish, and went back through in by the fireplace and got the biggest chunk of fire that he could find and stuffed down in his pipe and went off. And Jack and Tom got to the house, come in, and says, (Will shot out from behind the door), says, \u201cWhere is the dinner, Will?\u201d Says, \u201cHain\u2019t you cooked no dinner?\u201d He says, \u201cGosh,\u201d says, \u201cif you\u2019d a seed what I seed,\u201d said, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t want no dinner!\u201d And they \u2018gin to laugh, and Will says, \u201cAll right, laughing\u2019s catching,\u201d he says. \u201cTom,\u201d says, \u201ctomorrow\u2019ll be your turn.\u201d And so they fixed up a little, right quick, extra, then, and eat it, and went back and cleared that evening.

And said that beat any cloud of smoke, when he give that a few puffs, he ever seed in his life. And said he just struck out behind him then; follered him by the smoke down through a wilderness, way down in a holler. And while he had gone, Jack had\u2026While Jack was gone, Will and Tom come in and said, \u201cGood gracious!\u201d Says, \u201cThe dinner\u2019s on the table.\u201d Said, \u201cHe\u2019s eat Jack this time.\u201d Said, \u201cBoy, we\u2019ve lost Jack;\u201d said, \u201che\u2019s eat him.\u201d Said, \u201cThe dinner\u2019s on the table.\u201d Well, so Jack come in, directly. They said, \u201cWhere you been?\u201d Says, \u201cWe thought he\u2019d eat you up, account of dinner on the table.\u201d He said, \u201cNo.\u201d Says, \u201cI called him \u2018Dad\u2019,\u201d and said, \u201ctried to get him to stay and make a seat and get him a chair in the fire-setting room and wait, and was setting it on the table.\u201d And said, \u201cJust got it set on the table when I left.\u201d And he says, \u201cI found out where he went.\u201d Says, \u201cHe went down there, way down in the wilderness of that holler.\u201d And said, \u201cHe went in a hole in the ground.\u201d And so they eat then and \u2018gin to rig up to find out what was in there. And they eat and fixed \u2018em a basket out of splits and took and made \u2018em a rope out of hickory bark and went down to the hole. And they let Will down first. And they fixed it\u2026Will\u2026if that Will hit any trouble, he was to shake the rope of the hickory bark. And so, just hadn\u2019t went down but just a few feet till Will shook it and they snaked him back out just as fast as they could and they says, \u201cWhat did you see, Will?\u201d He said, \u201cI seed a house under there.\u201d And so they put Tom in it then, and let him down, and he was gone down just a little longer and he shook it and they jerked him out and says, \u201cTom, what did you see?\u201d He said, \u201cI seed a house and barn.\u201d And so they put Jack in then and let him down, and Jack let \u2018em let on down till he hit on the top of the roof. And he let it ease on down and he slid of the eaves. And he let it ease on down in the yard. And so he got out of the basket and went and pecked on the door. And a girl come; the oldest girl, which he didn\u2019t know it, when he pecked. And he says, \u201cHowdy.\u201d And she was so pretty till he just started in talking courting right when he seed her. And she says, \u201cOh,\u201d says, \u201cdon\u2019t do that!\u201d Said, \u201cThe second room you come to,\u201d said, \u201chas got one in it prettier than I am.\u201d And so Jack went on in and seed her and she was so much prettier till the first word he spoke was courting, wanting to court. And she says, \u201cOh, don\u2019t do that!\u201d She said, \u201cThe third one, in the third room,\u201d she said, \u201cis a beauty.\u201d Said, \u201cShe\u2019s the prettiest one of the bunch.\u201d So Jack went on in and seed her, and he just got to talking about getting married, she was so pretty. And so, she \u2018posed to him and tied a ribbon in her hair, and she put a wishing ring on his finger. And so told him that the Fire Dragon was a-coming back any minute. And said, \u201cHere\u2019s some ointment;\u201d said, \u201cIf he hits you with any if them fire-balls,\u201d says, \u201cthey burn a streak!\u201d And says, \u201cHere\u2019s a sword,\u201d said, \u201cis all that\u2019ll hurt him is a silver sword.\u201d Well, so Jack took the ointment and, in just a few minutes, the Fire Dragon come in and seed him and \u2018gin to make at him and spit them fire-balls. Said it was a sight to see them sparkle over the floor. And he dodged him around and some would glance him and burn him, and he\u2019d rub that ointment right quick, and try to get a lick with that sword. And said, directly, he got a lick and just swiped his head slick off. Well, he then fixed up to get the girls out of there. And he put the first one in the basket, that he met when he knocked on the door, and sent her up\u2014or shook the hickory rope and they pulled it up. And Will and Tom got to jarring off of it; said, \u201cThis one\u2019s mine!\u201d Directly she says, \u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d Says, \u201cThe next one is a-coming is prettier yet than I am.\u201d And so they shoved the basket back down in quick as they could, and Jack put the second one in it and shook the hickory rope and they flounced her out, and he heard \u2018em a raring over her. And said Will said, \u201cGood gosh, don\u2019t you put your hands on her; that one\u2019s mine.\u201d Tom said, \u201cDon\u2019t you touch her; that one\u2019s mine.\u201d She says, \u201cOh,\u201d says, \u201cdon\u2019t do that.\u201d Says, \u201cThe third one, the last one that\u2019s down there, is a beauty.\u201d Said, \u201cShe\u2019s the top.\u201d And so they shoved the basket down as quick as they could, and that was Jack\u2019s\u2014they\u2019d done \u2018posed to be married and had the ribbon in her hair. And so Jack out her in the basket. And Will and Tom, she was so much prettier, they got to fighting around over her. And she says, \u201cDon\u2019t fight.\u201d Says, \u201cI\u2019m done supposed to be married to Jack.\u201d They said, \u201cWell,\u201d \u2013 just pitched the hickory rope and the basket right down in the hole\u2014and said, \u201clet the rascal stay down in there.\u201d And said, \u201cHe\u2019ll not get you.\u201d And so they took \u2018em and went back to the new ground shanty. And Jack stayed in there and eat all the rations up that the Fire Dragon had, he thought. And he stayed a week or two. And, directly, he got to getting weak, and he hunted around and he found a few more bites to eat, a little more. And he got to feeling so weak, till he looked down and\u2026looking at his fingers to see how much he\u2019d fell off, what time he\u2019d been down in there. And he looked, and his fingers was fell off, and the made him notice the ring. Hit was so loose it would fall off his fingers, from the time he\u2019d been in there. And that made him think about the ring, and he said, \u201cI wish I was home with my mother, a-setting in the chimley corner, a-smoking my old \u2018kachuckety\u2019 (?) pipe.\u201d And said, just as the words got out of his mouth, there he was a-setting, and his mother a-talking to him. She said, \u201cJack,\u201d she said, \u201clooks like you ought to be to the new ground a-helping Tom and Will clear.\u201d He says, \u201cBedad, that\u2019s where I\u2019m started.\u201d And so he got on up there and they had the three girls and was still a-fighting over them. And so, him and the youngest one, the prettiest one, married\u2014that had put the ring on his finger\u2014and the ribbon was in her hair yet. And her and Jack married, and Tom married the next one to her, and Jack\u2026ah, Will had to take the oldest. And the last time that I was around there, they\u2019d built more shanties and they was a-doing well.","title":"Hicks 2"},{"location":"texts/legends/","text":"Louisiana Legends about Treasure Introduction For those not interested in reading all 27 text files on GitHub, I have made a single document out of them. You will note that each text is one big blob of text. That\u2019s my doing. When I first set up this collection, I deleted all the line returns because I had not yet mastered how to remove them when I was working with them in code. I now know how to do that, and I am in the process of adding back the line breaks, which were, by and large, by clause. So, the second text would look like this: I went to meet an old man in Marrero, and he told me a story. He went to look for a treasure with some other men. And there was a controller who had brought a Bible to control the spirits. And when they arrived at the site, they saw a big horse coming through the woods with a man riding it, and when he dismounted, it was no longer a man on the horse. It was a dog. And he said the dog came and rubbed itself against his legs. He said it was growling. He said he knew the dog was touching him, but he didn\u2019t feel anything. It was like there was just a wind. And he said they all took off running. He lost his hat and his glasses and he tore all his clothes. And even the controller ran off and he never saw his Bible again after that. To assemble all the texts into a single file, I used a command line utility called tail which displays the contents of a file with regard to line numbers. In the case of the command below, I told it to start with the first line, a rather long tail: tail -n +1 *.txt > ../all.txt I tell it to take all the text files, *.txt in the current directory and write the output to a new file, all.txt in the next level up directory \u2013 in this case it was my desktop. The advantage of using tail over cat \u2013 a utility which con cat enates files \u2013 is that tail automatically separates the compiled files with the name of the file from which the content was drawn. In the case of the file above, that looked like this: ==> anc-089.txt <== Because I wanted things to look nicer for you, I decided to convert the file names into markdown-style headers so that I could use markdown to convert the files to HTML. To do that, I first chopped off the part of the file name I didn\u2019t need plus the right-hand side of the division marker: .txt <== and replaced it with ## , which is the other side of the Heading 2 markup in markdown, but it could just as well have been nothing. Having done that, I replaced the lefthand part of the divider, ==> with the beginning of the markdown indicator for a second level heading, ## . Again, a Replace All in a text editor and we are done. Then we run the completed document through a markdown implementation, converting it to HTML, and apply a cascading style sheet we already have lying around and presto! What follows are 27 folk narratives collected by Barry Ancelet (ANC), myself (LAU), Lindahl, Owens, and Harvison (LOH), and a number of my students (ULS). The Legends anc-088 In Charenton, north of Lake Charenton, there was an old Indian named Jim. And they asked old Jim where might be a certain marked oak tree north of the lake. And old Jim said he knew. So they went. They started digging. And as soon as they had dug a ways, there was a great big bull that came through the woods with flames coming out of his nose. So it passed. And it just touched the shovel of the man who was digging, and all of them got away. So as soon as the man looked, all the others were gone. So he left, too. And the man told the Indian, \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u2018\u2019I\u2019ll have to go back to town for a spirit controller.\u201d So he said, \u2018\u2019I\u2019ll be back.\u201d So some time later, he came back but it was during the time of the vigilantes, you know, the Ku Klux Klan. And his wife thought they were the ones who wanted to talk to him. So his wife didn\u2019t want him to go with them. So the spirit controller said to the Indian, \u201cWill you give us your share?\u201d And the Indian said, \u201cYes, go ahead, you all can have it.\u201d So they went. So some time later, the Indian said to my late father- He was going through the woods not far from there. So he decided he would go north of the lake to see, you know. The hole was there, and the chest, and the markings of dollars were on the wood that they have broken off of the chest. So they had found it. The spirit controller had done it. It must be that he controlled the bull, the fire-breathing bull. But they said the flame was coming out of its nose and they could hear it coming through the woods. They heard the wood cracking, you know, when he jumped. The louder it cracked, the closer he came, until he was right next to them. anc-089 I went to meet an old man in Marrero, and he told me a story. He went to look for a treasure with some other men. And there was a controller who had brought a Bible to control the spirits. And when they arrived at the site, they saw a big horse coming through the woods with a man riding it, and when he dismounted, it was no longer a man on the horse. It was a dog. And he said the dog came and rubbed itself against his legs. He said it was growling. He said he knew the dog was touching him, but he didn\u2019t feel anything. It was like there was just a wind. And he said they all took off running. He lost his hat and his glasses and he tore all his clothes. And even the controller ran off and he never saw his Bible again after that. anc-090 Mom said that they used to dig a lot for money. Lots and lots of money was taken out of the ground like that. And she said that her little brother had gone in the woods to get the cows. And he stayed longer than he was supposed to stay. So his mother spoke to him, and she wanted to know where he had been. So he said he had seen a little tomb in the woods. And he said there was a pile of leaves on the grave. And he had cleaned the tomb and he had danced on it. So he had had fun on this little tomb in the woods. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cif you did this, come and show me where it is.\u201d He went, but they were never able to find the place. anc-091 I know them well. There was Jesse Venable. That was their father. Oh yeah, they saw that often there. There were two buckets. One each end of the chain, you see. When you raised one, the other one went down. You could get water that way. Well, they went all by themselves there. Water flew out and splashed against the side of the big well, a square well. Oh yeah. There are some who claim that there was gas in the ground, but no. That wasn\u2019t it because they saw other things. Heard huge echoes as though the earth had split. They would go outside and there was nothing to see. There wasn\u2019t money buried there? Supposedly. That\u2019s what they said. The oak tree had been transplanted to indicate the place, mark the place. Where the money was. Many went to look for it. They looked often, but they couldn\u2019t find it, but they saw things. Oh yeah. This was true. I lived nearby for years, maybe twenty years, right next to that place. lau-013 One day \u2026 my family was kind of weird. Because they would always try to dig for money. So one day \u2026 I was young, about twelve I guess. So my mother \u2026 couldn\u2019t leave me home, had to take me out there. So we went out there, to a place called the country, some property we had out there, about an acre of land. So they said form a circle. And this is \u2026 my eyes seen this myself. We formed this circle, man. My brother, my brother was preaching. He was digging in the middle. We were all around him and he was digging in the middle. Man, he took that shovel. I guess from the way it looked it must have been a shovel deep, about like this. Something went yanga yanga yanga yang. And then went boom. And when you looked again, they had a fucking coffin, man. Solid gold. Open it up, nothing but coins in there. And then a bull appeared, just appeared out of nowhere. The bull had fire coming out his nose and his eye was red red red. And you hadn\u2019t supposed to talk, because it would break the chain of everything. That\u2019s just how it was. That bull started charging. I was trying to get out of there. I\u2019m young. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. My mother telling me just don\u2019t move. There ain\u2019t nothing, ain\u2019t nothing. You just seeing things. And that sucker come up from me to like where I\u2019m sitting to you and disappeared. Now you know that scared the shit out of me. I was damn near shitting in my clothes. My uncle come up in the car. And when he drove in the yard that shit exploded. And when I looked again it didn\u2019t look like anyone had dug in the ground at all. Everything disappeared. lau-014 Like I said my family was weird, they liked to dig for money and stuff. Said my grandfather had left us some money, and they was digging for it So one day we went, and I was at work, so I can see, we at a country spot, like our property. So I can see a lot of people dressed in white. So I\u2019m curious me. I said well shit what the hell is everybody doing out there dressed in white? I wanna see. So I goes out there. So they tell me you\u2019re working right now, just go home come back. You know, come back after work. So I goes back, man, after work. So, they all in the house. We all praying man, everyone\u2019s on their knees praying. They got an excavator in the back yard, digging. You understand? Find this money, I guess. We\u2019re on our knees, man, we\u2019re praying. It\u2019s like in the pit of the summer like here. No wind nothing. They had a wind come through the house. That wind was so strong: my aunt was holding onto the door like that and both her legs was in the air. That\u2019s how strong the wind was. In the house. So they said \u2014 they picked me, my nephew, the one I was telling you that talk all that shit, and my little niece to go bring some water to the workers in back, the one that was doing the work. So we got to walking. We passed on the side of the house to bring them. So my nephew said, say man you see that guy in the tree? I said man fuck I don\u2019t see nobody in no tree. He said yeah man he be right there sitting on that limb. I said I don\u2019t see nobody man. I\u2019m getting scared now. Man I don\u2019t see nobody. But he\u2019s seeing this, you know. So he said \u2014 I said how he look? It\u2019s a guy, he said, it\u2019s a guy dressed in a pirate suit, man. He said he got a pirate hat on. He got a pirate jacket. And he started talking to him. The guy in the tree started talking to him while he\u2019s telling me this. But the guy in the tree is tell him shut up don\u2019t tell me that. So he telling me, man, look he right there. You can\u2019t see him? Look he right there on that branch. He say he want something more to drink You know, because what they had did: they\u2019d put a bowl in the back yard, under this tree, with some alcohol in it. You understand? And I don\u2019t know if it was the sun that would dissolve it, but it would be gone. Okay, so he say he say man he want another drink. So I said fuck man don\u2019t tell me that. I wanna get back in the house. I said I don\u2019t see nobody up there. So we kept on walking. We went out there. We brung them some water. So on our way back. Look at him. He say, see you, you son of a bitch. He say you don\u2019t wanna give me another drink, huh? He say you gonna be just like me. He say you see this here peg leg? He say you going to be just like me. He say for this out here y\u2019all are going to have to lose something. So, man, it got kind of scared. We started walking fast. By the time we got to the house, I broke out a run. A shovel, man, come from the back of the house. I mean full force. That shovel stuck in that tree so deep we had to dig it out with an axe. It stuck \u2014 you know with a shovel, it\u2019s hard to stick a shovel into anything. That shovel went inside the tree halfway. loh-157 The man whose story I\u2019m going to tell you as far as I know actually lived, because I played around his grave a lot. He was buried, still buried, where we lived. He was buried in the yard where I lived. They had built a cypress picket fence around it. By the time I was old enough to know anything, the picket fence was falling apart. But it was still intact, partially. This was a guy by the name of Fisher, which is obviously not a Cajun name. Supposedly Fisher and his wife and Fisher\u2019s wife\u2019s son, whose name was Billy, came to live in that house. Where they came from, nobody knows. The story is, and this is rumor and speculation, that he was a bank robber. He had moved into that house to sort of disappear. He was a drunk. Every time he\u2019d go to town, he\u2019d get drunk. This would have been Church Point, the closest town. He\u2019d go on horseback and go to town and come back drunk and beat up on Billy. One afternoon he came back drunk and Billy shot him. Killed him. His wife and Billy buried him right there. That night as it was dark, they left in the buggy, supposedly with a lot of gold. They came up to Jean Jannise Jr.\u2019s house. This is not the loup garou, this is his son, who was living \u2013and the house is still there, not the house but the place. When they got there, she looked upon Jean Jr. as a reliable man. She stopped there right after dark. It\u2019s always after dark! He told her, \u201cIf you try to cross this forest at night, you\u2019re going to be robbed. Why don\u2019t you stay here tonight and tomorrow you can go.\u201d Supposedly she was returning to Mississippi. That night, supposedly, she buried her money on the other side of Jean Jr.\u2019s house, a lot of gold. Tremendous amount of gold. She never returned so the gold is still there. I had a friend of mine who told me that was true because all drunks have a lot of money to bury! And that\u2019s my reaction to that story. loh-158 There was so much Lafitte activity here, then legend glorified it. Then Texas picked up on it at Galveston. There\u2019s a lot of stories. In the little town of Duson over near Lafayette, on Highway Ninety near Lafayette, you\u2019ll notice there\u2019s a little Catholic church on the left side of the road when you\u2019re coming this way, just a little out of town. There\u2019s a man named Judice who was very active in public affairs. He had a man plowing his field and the plow hit something. They opened it up and it was a big chest full of jewels and gold coins. All of them had early dates, and there were French coins and early American coins. They were buried there. They said it was Lafitte. They don\u2019t know who it was. But this negro man who found this built the Catholic church and the school there with part of the money. Seven years later, I guess jealousy, it burned down. He rebuilt it. Seven years later, it burned down again. He rebuilt it again. How much he had left I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s one case, and there\u2019s well-established fact on it. loh-159 Where Hodges Gardens now is, my Dad was hauling pine knots. They used to fire these locomotives, these trains. The locomotives would pull the log engines. They fired them with pine knots. He was hauling that stuff and selling to the railroads. He was working oxen. He stopped at a little branch to water his oxen, saw something glittering in the water, went to pick it up and it was a gold brick. A gold brick. Now, that was a bullion. These Mexicans would mine it (gold) and make it into little bricks. Now, the way he described it. I was too young to remember it. I was a baby at the time. He described it, like, it would have been like a small Hershey bar the way he described it. Well, him and his brother, they went down the little branch digging and hunting to see if there was any more. But they never could find any more. He put it over the door facing, and he\u2019d show it to everybody that came in. One day, he went to show it to someone and it was gone. Somebody had put it in their pocket while he wasn\u2019t looking, and he lost it. Now, he [his father] had a cousin that found a gold . . . It was not a bar; it was some kind of medallion. They said it was hexagon shaped and had Spanish writing on it. He did about the same thing. Some guy was gonna send it off and see what it was worth, and that was the end of it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m not a rich man today; my relatives didn\u2019t hang on to their money! loh-160 I was in Leesville one day, in the grocery store, and a man told me, said, \u201cYou ought to talk to my dad. He\u2019s got a very interesting story he can tell you.\u201d I said, \u201cI want to talk to him, by all means.\u201d So I went to see him, and he is a man by the name of Smith. They own the Piggly Wiggly store in Leesville. There\u2019s two of the brothers. I don\u2019t know if it was John, who is a state representative, John Smith, or if it was his brother. One of them told me about it. One of them told me to go see their dad. So Mr. Smith told me, he said that his grandfather, a man by the name of Brock, originally lived in Marthaville, Louisiana, in Natchitoches Parish. He had moved to the Rio Grande valley and was a farmer. This was along about 1912. There was a bandit by the name of Pancho Villa. He would come across the river and raid farms in Texas. Finally, well, for years they were trying to get the federal government to do something about it. They were pretty slow to react to it. He finally went up to Columbus, New Mexico. Killed a lot of people up there and done a lot of damage. They sent General Pershing. Later on, he was a famous World War I general over in Europe. He never did catch Pancho Villa, but he got close enough for Pancho Villa to decide he better stay out of the United States. Run him back across the river. But back to my story, he raided a farm next to Mr. Brock\u2019s. I suppose he probably killed some people, took what valuables they had, gold or stock. Scared Mr. Brock up pretty bad, and he decided he\u2019d just leave. Get out of there if that\u2019s the way it was gonna be. So he was packing up to come back to Marthaville, and there was an old Mexican on his place. Come to him and says, \u201cMr. Brock, I\u2019m gonna give you a map where you can dig up some money when you get back to Louisiana.\u201d Well, I stopped Mr. Smith right there and I said, \u201cNow, look, why didn\u2019t the Mexican go dig it up?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, he was an alien. He was not an American citizen. In those days, a law officer would just shoot one down.\u201d Mr. Brock came on back. In the spring of the year, he was making a crop. He had two grown boys to help him. They were after the old man, \u201cLet\u2019s go dig up the money. Let\u2019s go dig up the money.\u201d He was afraid they wouldn\u2019t get the crop in. But after the crop was laid by in the summertime, he said, \u201cAlright boys, we\u2019ll go see about it.\u201d So they went straight and dug up. There was a little cave. They dug the money up. It was twenty thousand dollars in silver. No gold. Mr. Smith told me, \u201cI took my grandfather back there several times. He wanted to go see where this money was dug up, so I took him there several times.\u201d I asked him, \u201cWell, would you take me and show me where it was?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll try. It\u2019s been a long time.\u201d Understand that they have straightened that road out. It used to have terrible curves. So we got over there. We went up there. It got pretty close to the place, and he said, \u201cIt\u2019s somewhere. I know it\u2019s over here somewhere.\u201d We went about a mile or two and he said, \u201cWe went too far.\u201d We never could locate just where it was, but he said, \u201cIt\u2019s right in here on this ridge.\u201d He said that these two uncles came in later and used dynamite, hoping to find some more. But they didn\u2019t find any more. There was an outlaw by the name of West. I believe, the best I remember, he might have rode with Murrell. He might have been in Murrell\u2019s gang when he was young. I think he was a Civil War veteran. I think he fought in the war. But he built him up a good little gang. But they were terrible as far as being heartless. Throw people in wells! Just let \u2018em starve to death! Killing babies, all kinds of stuff. West was the outlaw that did that (buried the money), according to the Mexican. He was with West and remembered it well enough to draw that map loh-161 I\u2019ll tell another little story. A friend of mine told me this story. She was raised down here on Toro Creek, just off of one-seventy-one Highway. She said that, I knew that there was an old stage coach route that came through where Hodges Gardens is now, just west of this Toro Church we were talking about. I didn\u2019t know that they had an old stage station over there. Nobody ever told me that. If they did, I\u2019d forgotten it. But she said there was an old stage station right close to where they lived. It was just off the road going to Toro Church. She went to church there when she was a girl. She said one day, one Sunday, they were going to church. There was a bunch of guys in a car, stopped over there, had shovels with them and everything. They stopped and asked them if they had trouble and could they help them. \u201cWhat are you doing in the country, on a country road?\u201d They told them that no, they had car trouble, but they had it fixed. So they went on to church. When they came back after church, the kids went out to the old stage station. It was close to the road. That\u2019s where they had stopped. Said it was a big rock. I asked her, \u201cWas the rock part of the foundation of the building?\u201d She said, \u201cI think it was more foundation for the chimney.\u201d She said that rock had been turned over, and there was a neat, little vault about eight inches square and maybe eight inches deep. There it was, a neat little vault with nothing in it. She figured they\u2019d gotten gold or money out of it. That happened in the thirties. loh-162 Years ago, when the Perkins started over into this area from Mississippi, this family pooled all their money. They had it in a flour barrel. John Reed\u2019s great grandmother had it in her family and had a cloth over it. One of the kin folks\u2019 children come over there one cold morning and didn\u2019t have any shoes. She took him aside about where his shoes were and all, and he said, \u201cI just don\u2019t have any.\u201d She said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m gonna stop that.\u201d She went in to the pantry where this flour barrel was. John Reed\u2019s grandmother went with her. She was just a little girl then. She said her grandmother, John Reed\u2019s great grandmother, threw this cloth back and reached in there and got a piece of money and gave it to this little kid. Told him, \u201cNow you tell your mother to buy you some shoes.\u201d Well, while she was doin\u2019 this, John\u2019s grandmother, she couldn\u2019t see into the barrel, but she reached over it and she could feel this money. There was that much money in there in this flour barrel. They had pooled all their money and put it together. So later on, one of \u2018em, I don\u2019t know which one, was charged (given the responsibility) with taking this money and what was it? A couple of slaves. He headed west to buy land for the whole family. He was supposed to buy land. But he got down to where they call Big Woods, and he sickened and died. Now, the slaves told the story that this money is buried in there. By the time they made their way back to Mississippi, they couldn\u2019t remember where it was. They had buried all this money he had. What it was in then, I don\u2019t know. It was probably in boxes. Evidently, this money was supposed to be buried there. That money, as far as anybody knows, has never been discovered. But that whole area has been dug up! loh-162b Her (his wife, Maggie) father one time, when he was a boy, there used to be a store just west of here, Field\u2019s. It\u2019s still there. He was playing there on the porch, and he had a nugget. One of what they call a drummer, a salesman, come by and said, \u201cLet me see that, son.\u201d He looked at it and it was supposedly silver. He gave him fifty cents. Told him, \u201cI\u2019ll pay you more if you take me\u201d \u2013 now, there\u2019s a little creek out there, Windham Creek \u2013 \u201cIf you take me back and show me where you found this.\u201d He said he was just about eight or nine years old, playing along this creek. He was sure he could find it, so he took this fellow up there to show him where it was. He never could find the place where he found it. One time out east of town here, a guy found a stump full of money. A hollow tree. Come to find out, it was slot machines stolen from the old Pines nightclub. All these nickels and stuff was hidden in this stump, in this hollow tree. loh-163 One of the most famous stories here is after the War of 1812. Jean Lafitte, the pirate, was still active here. He helped the United States in the Battle of New Orleans when Jackson defeated the British. They let him go, and he went to Galveston. The city of Galveston was founded by Jean Lafitte. He moved, supposedly, all his operations and headquarters outside the jurisdiction of the United States. But his biggest market, of course, was New Orleans. He would ply his piracy and his trade there. At night, they knew all these swamps and innerland that the U.S. didn\u2019t know, the Coast Guard didn\u2019t know. And he would slip his stuff in through Barataria Bay and peddle it to New Orleans. One time one of his sloops or ships was apprehended, almost apprehended, by the U.S. Coast Guard. When they got to what they thought was waters outside of the United States, they turned into Sabine Lake. But it wasn\u2019t at that time outside of the United States. The Coast Guard was so close behind them that they scuttled their ship and sank it. There\u2019s always been a claim that they buried whatever they had somewhere in that area. People still look for the money there. loh-164 Have you all heard anything about hunting money? Well, that\u2019s the thing I\u2019m gonna get involved with here. I went on a hunting expedition. And people don\u2019t know what actually goes on. I was invited to go on this trip, and they explained to me what it was. I\u2019d never heard of it before. That was news to me. Okay, people a long time ago (pause) they claimed they buried their money. That was back when they had the slaves and all that there. And they, this old slave owner, he\u2019d have a lot of money to bury. Well, he\u2019d take his most-trusted slave he had. His old slave. And he\u2019d take him with him. Well, he\u2019d go out and he\u2019d pick him out a spot where he wanted it. And he\u2019d tell the old slave, \u201cNow, I want you to dig right here.\u201d And he\u2019d put it about four or five foot deep. Well, the old slave\u2019d be down there digging. When he thought it was deep enough, the old slave owner\u2019d tell him, \u201cNow, look. I want you to promise me something. That you\u2019ll guard this money as long as you can.\u201d And the old slave\u2019d say, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll do that, boss.\u201d Well, then he would, he\u2019d shoot him. Kill him. Well, then the owner\u2019d cover the hole up. He was the only man that knew where it was. That slave down in there, the belief was, that the slave, his spirit, would continue to guard that money. Well, these people decided how to get around that. Well, I went off on this trip with \u2018em. I saw things I thought I\u2019d never see again. They told me when they went, they said, \u201cYou gotta be pure.\u201d Now, these are grown men. These ain\u2019t little boys. They said, \u201cYou can\u2019t have any dealings with your wife for a week, at least seven days before this hunt.\u201d Well, these guys hired a man from the other side of Houma to come over here. He was supposed to be a professional finder. Well, he done it for a fee. They had to pay him, his expenses, to come over here. He brought a guy with him, and the two of \u2018em drove from Houma over here. He had a forked rod. And that\u2019s the thing he used to hunt the money with there. They could find it. Well, we went way out in the country to an old plantation deal there. They told us, they said, \u201cNow, y\u2019all stay here. And if that money\u2019s within a mile of here, we can find it.\u201d And he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll come back and get y\u2019all.\u201d So he told \u2018em all that. Well, we sat there in the dark, and he told us, \u201cNow don\u2019t talk loud. Y\u2019all can just whisper.\u201d So it was weird. I mean I was sitting there, and I didn\u2019t know what was going on. Well, in a little while, they come back. And the guy said, \u201cWe\u2019ve located it.\u201d He said, \u201cNow, this is what I want y\u2019all to do. When we start out to get it, they can\u2019t nobody say another word.\u201d So, we trailed along behind \u2018em back through the woods. And it was dark. We was stumbling over roots and everything else. And we finally got to the point, the place there, and they had an old lantern. It was the only light we had, and they had it up in front. We was all in the back. And they got up there and sure enough, there was that forked piece of metal sticking in the ground where they\u2019d located it. Well, they told us, and everybody, wasn\u2019t nobody saying a word. They was motioning, stand back and all that there. Well, all at once, this guy come out with a little old box. This was the part that was weird to me. He got that box and he went in there and he had some white powder. I know it was flour. That\u2019s what it looked like. He went and made a big circle around the whole thing. That was to keep that spirit in there. In other words, to keep that spirit from getting that money and running with it. It was their belief that once you got that powder around it, he couldn\u2019t cross that powder. Well, they got there and they got that old powder\u2019d up. Then they started digging. And I mean they was going at it fast. Nobody wasn\u2019t saying a word, it was just strictly just everybody was working. I didn\u2019t know nothing about it. I did get in there and dig just a little bit, but I was [pause] more or less [pause] wanting to watch than anything else. Well, they dug a hole , I bet you, it was seven-foot deep. You could\u2019ve buried a car in it. There was some of them fellers there, they wouldn\u2019t work in a pie factory. But boy they was at it with that digging. Well, they was going at it and all at once, one of them fellers got a coughing spell. Well when he did, this guy that was supposed to be the professional, he just got up and said, \u201cBoys, it\u2019s all over with.\u201d He said, \u201cIt\u2019s gone now.\u201d He said, \u201cI told you, you can\u2019t make no noise of no kind!\u201d He said, \u201cNow you can dig all day and they ain\u2019t no money there now.\u201d And that wound the money hunting up. Since then, I\u2019ve heard other people talk about going on trips, and they always blame it on something! Even one time, they got so mad with one of the guys, they thought he\u2019d lied [inaudible]. They thought he was lying. I never heard of nobody finding the money. But they\u2019re right close to it. Now, there\u2019s people right today that\u2019s still doing it. Here a while back, I heard a man down below his house there, he went to work one morning and there was a hole there the side of the field. He said he don\u2019t know when they dug that! It was some time during the night! loh-165 You know, some people believe in haints and some don\u2019t. Ghosts or whatever they call them. But it\u2019s something. Something that I couldn\u2019t explain now. I\u2019ve seen things, heard things. A lot of people don\u2019t believe it. But I have seen things happen on different occasions, living in the country. It\u2019s unexplainable. I don\u2019t know why or what it was, but I\u2019ve seen things that I just couldn\u2019t explain what it was. I was trying to remember the time that three fellows came up and asked me to go with them and show them where I had seen, what they said, the haints, spirits. I actually seen it, and they said wherever you see something like that, well usually treasure, money buried around. These three fellows came up and asked me would I show them where I seen this spirit or whatever it was. I\u2019m getting ahead. What I really seen, must\u2019ve been about nine, ten years old. About first dark one night, I was on my way home. First I heard something that sounded like singing, moaning a song or something. I stopped to see what it was, and then when I did see it, it looked almost like them clouds out there. But it wasn\u2019t as big as that cloud, it was just like a vapor like. But it was just floating through the air. I couldn\u2019t make out what it was, and when I realized it wasn\u2019t real, when it passed by the chicken house, the chickens started cuttin\u2019 up. And it came in front of me, and went out in the [inaudible] and just settled down. But it was still like it was singing. By that time, I done got up enough nerve in my feet to run. And I taken off to the house. Run in there and told my dad about it. And so he said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s just somebody out there trying to scare you.\u201d And he got up, got the shotgun, went outside. I told him, I went out to the porch and showed him where the last time I seen it was. So he went on out that aways. I come on back in the house, waiting to hear the gun to go off. Few minutes, still hadn\u2019t heard the gun go off, I heard him coming back running! He said when he got out there, when he raised that gun up to where I had told him that thing was, said something got all over him and that gun. Man, he come back in that house. Said something was out there. After that, these two men came along must\u2019ve been about twenty-five, thirty years later, wanting to know where did I see this at. And I told them. They asked me could they go back there. Well, the house had been torn down and all growed up out there now. So anyway, I\u2019m taking them out there, and these fellows had one of these treasure things, like you hunt buried treasure with. He had one of those, and one of them had some other kind of little gimmick. Another had a little Testament, a New Testament. I got to the place we was supposed to go. So this fellow with the little Bible, he went out and sat down on a log and started reading. Fellow with this treasure deal, he started moving it around on the ground. Finally this thing started making some kind of whining noise. Getting louder and louder. And so he said, \u201cSomething down here.\u201d We got a shovel and dug down in there. Kept in and dug a little more. Finally didn\u2019t did no more. We taking it out the hole, and that\u2019s where they found it. When we did find it, a fifty cents piece. Search and search, couldn\u2019t find nothing else. I said, \u201cWell, this ain\u2019t where I seen the haint at. It\u2019s over here between these two cedar trees. We went over there. He got in between them trees, and I said, \u201cIt\u2019s closer to the one on the right.\u201d And so he went over that way, and that thing started making this whining noise and going on. At this time, a great big, I say a blackbird. Looked like a blackbird to me, but it was real black. It looked like it was blue. But it had a real yellow beak, and two big orange eyes, and he lit up in that cedar tree and he starts making croaking noise like a crow. Then another one, then another one. The more we searched, the more them big old birds get in that tree. Finally, them birds, got so many got in that tree it look like it was just leaning backwards and forwards. This man told me, said, \u201cI tell you what, something has been here. But somebody done found it now.\u201d Said, \u201cWe better go!\u201d He packed up his junk, we left. But I honestly believe they went back out after I had helped them locate where I thought. I didn\u2019t know what was there, but I believe they located something and they went back after they got rid of me. Keep from dividing with me. If there was anything there, keep from dividing with me. It was near night, so they carried me back home, and I wasn\u2019t about to go back there by myself! But anyway, that\u2019s what happened that particular night. uls-001 A relative of ours lived in the country near the woods of Morse and Crowley when she was a little girl. She lived in an house that was stilts so that when a flood came their house would be okay. When she was a child, our relative would play with the other kids under the house during the summer to stay out of the heat. The story goes that our relative, along with the rest of the children, saw a man sitting on a wooden chest beneath the house. This apparition did nothing to the children, although it did frighten them for a time. Strangely, only our relative and the children could see it. Not the adults. uls-002 The same relative had a husband who went out into the wooded region in that area. Along with his brother, they went looking for cypress moss for cushioning their pillows and blankets. This was way back in the day. As they were searching, they noticed a stone slab on the ground beneath a tree. It was odd because the husband and his brother weren\u2019t able to move the slab of stone. It seemed to be stuck in the ground. Then, they got this weird feeling. Something wasn\u2019t quite right with the stone. The two men freaked out, and they climbed the tree in fear. When they looked down, the slab of stone disappeared. They jumped down from the tree and ran home. uls-003 Later that same day, after my grandmother had told me these stories, I heard almost the exact same story told by a friend of mine. This story seems to be a common legend in southern Louisiana. He said that two relatives of his went hunting out in the woods one night. When and where exactly, I don\u2019t know. They too saw the stone slab. Upon returning to the woods again to find it, it had disappeared. My friend said that the mysterious stone slab never stays in the same place. And if one sees it, you\u2019re supposed to dig in front of it to find buried treasure. My friend also mentioned how some people see a tombstone instead of stone slab. Some people also see a man standing next to or is sitting on the stone. uls-004 Upon hearing this, I couldn\u2019t help but think of pirates who buried their treasure in southern Louisiana. I learned in history this semester that pirates would bury their treasure on land and ask one of the crewmen to protect it. The one to protect the treasure was shot dead, so that his soul would guard the treasure forever. Perhaps these two stories are connected in some way. uls-005 So, they had this old man, this is like the slave era in Louisiana. Well, not necessarily slave but, you had this era where they had kind of like Jim Crow laws, you know? They weren\u2019t born slaves anymore, but they still worked in a kind of indentured servitude, in a kind of fashion. And, he had, this old man he had a couple of \u201cslaves\u201d, and what he would do, (he was very cruel, a cruel man, a cruel master. He\u2019s very superstitious though) so what he would do if a slave did something wrong, in order to guard his fortune, he would either bury them alive while holding his money, his money or something valuable, and even it would get morbid, like, they had old whiskey barrels, and he would put glass and nails on them and then roll them downhills. He was just cruel. Well, the day that he died they said that he spontaneously combusted and that, nothing else burnt. The only thing that was left of him was a giant suit mark on the bed, where he was. He died in his bed. uls-006 Me and my brothers would hear this story a lot from one of our neighbor\u2019s parents, she said she was a fortune teller. Supposedly, there was treasure buried by a stump and only a child could find it. The treasure would rise up out of the ground and appear to the children. The only time a child could find it is if they were playing by the stump, but if they left to go get help to get the treasure, when they came back for it, it was gone. It had disappeared. It didn\u2019t pay for a grown up to go look for it because they wouldn\u2019t find it. uls-007 I had a cousin, he\u2019s dead now, he served during Vietnam as a navy seal, and when he came back\u00ad. In the same woods, there\u2019s like a legend saying that (it\u2019s an old Indian legend) that if you find this kind of like plate\u2026 it looks kind of like, some sort of like Indian, like native american\u2026writing, or just mosaics like that, so, if you find this plate, according to the legend, where that plate sits, right underneath is a great treasure. Well, my cousin Glen was in the woods one day, he might have been hunting or something, he finds this kind of plate, and he remembered that legend, so what he did was he tried to make a trail on the way back, like scratching trees, like carving certain stuff in trees, to make sure that he could make his way back, he didn\u2019t have shovels or anything. So he comes back, I think with someone else, maybe a friend, to come and dig it up, and where the plate was, was gone, and according to another little part of that legend, the reason why it shows up is the spirits are trying to kind of play a trick on you, to get you lost in the woods, \u2018cause he\u2019s like \u201coh, yeah, I wanna come back and\u201d \u2026 he was just smart and scratching his way, like marking his way back. uls-008 The legend goes the person- it was like a umm, a farm that people had lived on that farm And the white people killed somebody and buried some money under them to say to protect their money And during that time That\u2019s how- I guess- that\u2019s how things had work at the time But we found out And we went try to get it And we could never get it because something was always running around You could dig but the change -You could hear the change falling deeper and deeper and deeper The more you dig The deeper it get So we never had a chance to get to it. And I guess no one will get to it. uls-009 The thing is- Like he said, like Gator said The thing is back then A man asked a worker -must\u2019ve been a worker If he would\u2019ve watch his money And the worker- one of the workers said \u201cno\u201d And he asked this other worker if he wanted to watch his money The worker said \u201cyea\u201d he would\u2019ve watch his money So what they did- They kill him Bury him underground And the money And now you watching it So the one that say he was watching the money They kill him And they buried him Now he watching the money He said he was gonna watch it Yep. uls-010 That\u2019s it over there. They use to have a house in there. Right there where the trees is they use to have a house in there. Probably got the mark where the house is now. We used to go in there. We couldn\u2019t go \u2026 we use to \u2026 we use to travel. We use to hear they had gold there. We\u2019ll go try to dig it, couldn\u2019t dig, couldn\u2019t dig. Me, Dexter, Kenneth, your daddy. Just about all of us, I think Roland too. We all tried. Couldn\u2019t, you couldn\u2019t even get the shovel in the ground. It\u2019s a certain time you could\u2019ve get it in. But you wasn\u2019t finding nothing. And you would hear noise in there. You hear \u2026 you hear strange noise. There in the trees. Yeah they had some stuff in there. A spirit. uls-011 Nah I ain\u2019t scared to go over there. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s none to be scared of. But, but it\u2019s still strange to hear. I think them old people say that spirit will not let you dig to get to the gold, whatever\u2019s down there. That\u2019s what them old people used to say. Its not going let ya \u2026 and it\u2019s kinda strange they clean all that. They clean all the distance, but they never clean that spot there.","title":"Louisiana Legends about Treasure #"},{"location":"texts/legends/#louisiana-legends-about-treasure","text":"","title":"Louisiana Legends about Treasure"},{"location":"texts/legends/#introduction","text":"For those not interested in reading all 27 text files on GitHub, I have made a single document out of them. You will note that each text is one big blob of text. That\u2019s my doing. When I first set up this collection, I deleted all the line returns because I had not yet mastered how to remove them when I was working with them in code. I now know how to do that, and I am in the process of adding back the line breaks, which were, by and large, by clause. So, the second text would look like this: I went to meet an old man in Marrero, and he told me a story. He went to look for a treasure with some other men. And there was a controller who had brought a Bible to control the spirits. And when they arrived at the site, they saw a big horse coming through the woods with a man riding it, and when he dismounted, it was no longer a man on the horse. It was a dog. And he said the dog came and rubbed itself against his legs. He said it was growling. He said he knew the dog was touching him, but he didn\u2019t feel anything. It was like there was just a wind. And he said they all took off running. He lost his hat and his glasses and he tore all his clothes. And even the controller ran off and he never saw his Bible again after that. To assemble all the texts into a single file, I used a command line utility called tail which displays the contents of a file with regard to line numbers. In the case of the command below, I told it to start with the first line, a rather long tail: tail -n +1 *.txt > ../all.txt I tell it to take all the text files, *.txt in the current directory and write the output to a new file, all.txt in the next level up directory \u2013 in this case it was my desktop. The advantage of using tail over cat \u2013 a utility which con cat enates files \u2013 is that tail automatically separates the compiled files with the name of the file from which the content was drawn. In the case of the file above, that looked like this: ==> anc-089.txt <== Because I wanted things to look nicer for you, I decided to convert the file names into markdown-style headers so that I could use markdown to convert the files to HTML. To do that, I first chopped off the part of the file name I didn\u2019t need plus the right-hand side of the division marker: .txt <== and replaced it with ## , which is the other side of the Heading 2 markup in markdown, but it could just as well have been nothing. Having done that, I replaced the lefthand part of the divider, ==> with the beginning of the markdown indicator for a second level heading, ## . Again, a Replace All in a text editor and we are done. Then we run the completed document through a markdown implementation, converting it to HTML, and apply a cascading style sheet we already have lying around and presto!

And as soon as they had dug a ways, there was a great big bull that came through the woods with flames coming out of his nose. So it passed. And it just touched the shovel of the man who was digging, and all of them got away. So as soon as the man looked, all the others were gone. So he left, too. And the man told the Indian, \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u2018\u2019I\u2019ll have to go back to town for a spirit controller.\u201d So he said, \u2018\u2019I\u2019ll be back.\u201d So some time later, he came back but it was during the time of the vigilantes, you know, the Ku Klux Klan. And his wife thought they were the ones who wanted to talk to him. So his wife didn\u2019t want him to go with them. So the spirit controller said to the Indian, \u201cWill you give us your share?\u201d And the Indian said, \u201cYes, go ahead, you all can have it.\u201d So they went. So some time later, the Indian said to my late father- He was going through the woods not far from there. So he decided he would go north of the lake to see, you know. The hole was there, and the chest, and the markings of dollars were on the wood that they have broken off of the chest. So they had found it. The spirit controller had done it. It must be that he controlled the bull, the fire-breathing bull. But they said the flame was coming out of its nose and they could hear it coming through the woods. They heard the wood cracking, you know, when he jumped. The louder it cracked, the closer he came, until he was right next to them.","title":"anc-088"},{"location":"texts/legends/#anc-089","text":"I went to meet an old man in Marrero, and he told me a story.

We\u2019re on our knees, man, we\u2019re praying. It\u2019s like in the pit of the summer like here. No wind nothing. They had a wind come through the house.

He was buried, still buried, where we lived. He was buried in the yard where I lived. They had built a cypress picket fence around it. By the time I was old enough to know anything, the picket fence was falling apart. But it was still intact, partially. This was a guy by the name of Fisher, which is obviously not a Cajun name. Supposedly Fisher and his wife and Fisher\u2019s wife\u2019s son, whose name was Billy, came to live in that house. Where they came from, nobody knows. The story is, and this is rumor and speculation, that he was a bank robber. He had moved into that house to sort of disappear. He was a drunk. Every time he\u2019d go to town, he\u2019d get drunk. This would have been Church Point, the closest town. He\u2019d go on horseback and go to town and come back drunk and beat up on Billy. One afternoon he came back drunk and Billy shot him. Killed him. His wife and Billy buried him right there. That night as it was dark, they left in the buggy, supposedly with a lot of gold. They came up to Jean Jannise Jr.\u2019s house. This is not the loup garou, this is his son, who was living \u2013and the house is still there, not the house but the place. When they got there, she looked upon Jean Jr. as a reliable man.

He\u2019s got a very interesting story he can tell you.\u201d I said, \u201cI want to talk to him, by all means.\u201d So I went to see him, and he is a man by the name of Smith. They own the Piggly Wiggly store in Leesville. There\u2019s two of the brothers. I don\u2019t know if it was John, who is a state representative, John Smith, or if it was his brother. One of them told me about it. One of them told me to go see their dad. So Mr. Smith told me, he said that his grandfather, a man by the name of Brock, originally lived in Marthaville, Louisiana, in Natchitoches Parish. He had moved to the Rio Grande valley and was a farmer. This was along about 1912. There was a bandit by the name of Pancho Villa. He would come across the river and raid farms in Texas. Finally, well, for years they were trying to get the federal government to do something about it. They were pretty slow to react to it. He finally went up to Columbus, New Mexico. Killed a lot of people up there and done a lot of damage. They sent General Pershing. Later on, he was a famous World War I general over in Europe. He never did catch Pancho Villa, but he got close enough for Pancho Villa to decide he better stay out of the United States. Run him back across the river. But back to my story, he raided a farm next to Mr. Brock\u2019s. I suppose he probably killed some people, took what valuables they had, gold or stock. Scared Mr. Brock up pretty bad, and he decided he\u2019d just leave. Get out of there if that\u2019s the way it was gonna be. So he was packing up to come back to Marthaville, and there was an old Mexican on his place. Come to him and says, \u201cMr. Brock, I\u2019m gonna give you a map where you can dig up some money when you get back to Louisiana.\u201d Well, I stopped Mr. Smith right there and I said, \u201cNow, look, why didn\u2019t the Mexican go dig it up?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, he was an alien. He was not an American citizen. In those days, a law officer would just shoot one down.\u201d Mr. Brock came on back. In the spring of the year, he was making a crop. He had two grown boys to help him. They were after the old man, \u201cLet\u2019s go dig up the money. Let\u2019s go dig up the money.\u201d He was afraid they wouldn\u2019t get the crop in. But after the crop was laid by in the summertime, he said, \u201cAlright boys, we\u2019ll go see about it.\u201d So they went straight and dug up. There was a little cave. They dug the money up. It was twenty thousand dollars in silver. No gold. Mr. Smith told me, \u201cI took my grandfather back there several times. He wanted to go see where this money was dug up, so I took him there several times.\u201d I asked him, \u201cWell, would you take me and show me where it was?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll try. It\u2019s been a long time.\u201d Understand that they have straightened that road out. It used to have terrible curves. So we got over there. We went up there. It got pretty close to the place, and he said, \u201cIt\u2019s somewhere. I know it\u2019s over here somewhere.\u201d We went about a mile or two and he said, \u201cWe went too far.\u201d We never could locate just where it was, but he said, \u201cIt\u2019s right in here on this ridge.\u201d He said that these two uncles came in later and used dynamite, hoping to find some more. But they didn\u2019t find any more. There was an outlaw by the name of West. I believe, the best I remember, he might have rode with Murrell. He might have been in Murrell\u2019s gang when he was young. I think he was a Civil War veteran. I think he fought in the war. But he built him up a good little gang. But they were terrible as far as being heartless. Throw people in wells! Just let \u2018em starve to death! Killing babies, all kinds of stuff.

Okay, people a long time ago (pause) they claimed they buried their money. That was back when they had the slaves and all that there. And they, this old slave owner, he\u2019d have a lot of money to bury. Well, he\u2019d take his most-trusted slave he had. His old slave. And he\u2019d take him with him.

Well, then the owner\u2019d cover the hole up. He was the only man that knew where it was. That slave down in there, the belief was, that the slave, his spirit, would continue to guard that money. Well, these people decided how to get around that. Well, I went off on this trip with \u2018em. I saw things I thought I\u2019d never see again. They told me when they went, they said, \u201cYou gotta be pure.\u201d Now, these are grown men. These ain\u2019t little boys.

He was supposed to be a professional finder. Well, he done it for a fee. They had to pay him, his expenses, to come over here. He brought a guy with him, and the two of \u2018em drove from Houma over here. He had a forked rod. And that\u2019s the thing he used to hunt the money with there. They could find it. Well, we went way out in the country to an old plantation deal there. They told us, they said, \u201cNow, y\u2019all stay here.

We was stumbling over roots and everything else. And we finally got to the point, the place there, and they had an old lantern. It was the only light we had, and they had it up in front. We was all in the back. And they got up there and sure enough, there was that forked piece of metal sticking in the ground where they\u2019d located it. Well, they told us, and everybody, wasn\u2019t nobody saying a word. They was motioning, stand back and all that there. Well, all at once, this guy come out with a little old box. This was the part that was weird to me. He got that box and he went in there and he had some white powder. I know it was flour. That\u2019s what it looked like. He went and made a big circle around the whole thing. That was to keep that spirit in there. In other words, to keep that spirit from getting that money and running with it. It was their belief that once you got that powder around it, he couldn\u2019t cross that powder. Well, they got there and they got that old powder\u2019d up. Then they started digging. And I mean they was going at it fast. Nobody wasn\u2019t saying a word, it was just strictly just everybody was working. I didn\u2019t know nothing about it. I did get in there and dig just a little bit, but I was [pause] more or less [pause] wanting to watch than anything else. Well, they dug a hole , I bet you, it was seven-foot deep. You could\u2019ve buried a car in it. There was some of them fellers there, they wouldn\u2019t work in a pie factory. But boy they was at it with that digging. Well, they was going at it and all at once, one of them fellers got a coughing spell. Well when he did, this guy that was supposed to be the professional, he just got up and said, \u201cBoys, it\u2019s all over with.\u201d He said, \u201cIt\u2019s gone now.\u201d He said, \u201cI told you, you can\u2019t make no noise of no kind!\u201d He said, \u201cNow you can dig all day and they ain\u2019t no money there now.\u201d And that wound the money hunting up.

I actually seen it, and they said wherever you see something like that, well usually treasure, money buried around. These three fellows came up and asked me would I show them where I seen this spirit or whatever it was. I\u2019m getting ahead. What I really seen, must\u2019ve been about nine, ten years old. About first dark one night, I was on my way home. First I heard something that sounded like singing, moaning a song or something.

Few minutes, still hadn\u2019t heard the gun go off, I heard him coming back running! He said when he got out there, when he raised that gun up to where I had told him that thing was, said something got all over him and that gun. Man, he come back in that house. Said something was out there. After that, these two men came along must\u2019ve been about twenty-five, thirty years later, wanting to know where did I see this at. And I told them. They asked me could they go back there. Well, the house had been torn down and all growed up out there now. So anyway, I\u2019m taking them out there, and these fellows had one of these treasure things, like you hunt buried treasure with. He had one of those, and one of them had some other kind of little gimmick. Another had a little Testament, a New Testament. I got to the place we was supposed to go. So this fellow with the little Bible, he went out and sat down on a log and started reading. Fellow with this treasure deal, he started moving it around on the ground. Finally this thing started making some kind of whining noise. Getting louder and louder. And so he said, \u201cSomething down here.\u201d We got a shovel and dug down in there. Kept in and dug a little more. Finally didn\u2019t did no more. We taking it out the hole, and that\u2019s where they found it. When we did find it, a fifty cents piece. Search and search, couldn\u2019t find nothing else. I said, \u201cWell, this ain\u2019t where I seen the haint at. It\u2019s over here between these two cedar trees. We went over there. He got in between them trees, and I said, \u201cIt\u2019s closer to the one on the right.\u201d And so he went over that way, and that thing started making this whining noise and going on. At this time, a great big, I say a blackbird. Looked like a blackbird to me, but it was real black. It looked like it was blue. But it had a real yellow beak, and two big orange eyes, and he lit up in that cedar tree and he starts making croaking noise like a crow. Then another one, then another one. The more we searched, the more them big old birds get in that tree. Finally, them birds, got so many got in that tree it look like it was just leaning backwards and forwards. This man told me, said, \u201cI tell you what, something has been here. But somebody done found it now.\u201d Said, \u201cWe better go!\u201d He packed up his junk, we left.

I didn\u2019t know what was there, but I believe they located something and they went back after they got rid of me. Keep from dividing with me.

In the same woods, there\u2019s like a legend saying that (it\u2019s an old Indian legend) that if you find this kind of like plate\u2026 it looks kind of like, some sort of like Indian, like native american\u2026writing, or just mosaics like that, so, if you find this plate, according to the legend, where that plate sits, right underneath is a great treasure. Well, my cousin Glen was in the woods one day, he might have been hunting or something, he finds this kind of plate, and he remembered that legend, so what he did was he tried to make a trail on the way back, like scratching trees, like carving certain stuff in trees, to make sure that he could make his way back, he didn\u2019t have shovels or anything. So he comes back, I think with someone else, maybe a friend, to come and dig it up, and where the plate was, was gone, and according to another little part of that legend, the reason why it shows up is the spirits are trying to kind of play a trick on you, to get you lost in the woods, \u2018cause he\u2019s like \u201coh, yeah, I wanna come back and\u201d \u2026 he was just smart and scratching his way, like marking his way back.","title":"uls-007"},{"location":"texts/legends/#uls-008","text":"The legend goes the person- it was like a umm, a farm that people had lived on that farm And the white people killed somebody and buried some money under them to say to protect their money And during that time That\u2019s how- I guess- that\u2019s how things had work at the time But we found out And we went try to get it And we could never get it because something was always running around You could dig but the change -You could hear the change falling deeper and deeper and deeper The more you dig The deeper it get So we never had a chance to get to it.
