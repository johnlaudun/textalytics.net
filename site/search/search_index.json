MW 9:00 \u2013 10:30, 2:30-3:00, and Tuesday mornings by appointment. 482-5493. laudun@louisiana.edu. Course Description My goals for this course are simple: first, to de-mystify reading as a process into a series of discreet activities so that students can understand how texts work: through content, through structure, and through intertextuality; second to have students practice various forms of writing, focusing especially on those forms that help you practice analysis and argumentation. Such writing assignments include, but are not limited to, summaries, outlines, analytical responses, and, of course, the synthetic essay. Course Materials Depending upon the semester, there will be books listed below, but the first thing you need to do is to log onto the course\u2019s Moodle site. (Please come to class before purchasing any books for this class. Sometimes plan change between the time the syllabus is constructed and the time at which a final plan is developed.) Over the years I have developed a number of custom versions of common texts in order to make it easier for you not only to engage in various kinds of reading practices and analyses but also to make sure there are common page numbers to enable better discussions. You will be responsible for printing these materials and having them in class, marked up, and ready to discuss. Reading from devices is prohibited and only reveals you have not read the syllabus clearly. The books you need to buy are: Dick, Philip K. 1970. A Maze of Death . Vintage. (We are going to use the 2013 reprint.) Order the books from your favorite bookseller, the university bookstore or Amazon. There are also a number of texts which are not scribal in nature. That is, this course also takes advantage of various video and audio presentations. Many of these are available in forms that require only a computer and internet connection of modest means: that is, you must have access to a computer that can accept video and audio streams. Some of the materials are copyrighted and require that you own them or you have access to them through a subscription service. You will need to arrange access to physical copies of these texts or to subscribe to services that provide you access to them. (The services you need are noted with the texts below, and you should add those costs to the total costs for this course. No exceptions.) Sadly, both the mainstay word processing applications, Microsoft Word and Apple Pages, are terrible at collaboration, review, and revision. This course uses Google Docs for major writing assignments: please make sure to familiarize yourself with its features and functions at your earliest convenience \u2013 announcing you do not have a Google Drive account or do not how to use it when an assignment is due means you haven\u2019t read the syllabus. I will only interact with drafts either in this format or in plain text using either Markdown or LaTeX via GitHub. (I will also provide you with a standard file-naming scheme for each document I ask you to submit: use it.) Finally, put away the spiral-bound notebooks, especially the multi-subject ones. Get yourself a notepad and a collection of file folders. More will be explained in class, but you should start by reading this note . Course Requirements The goal of the course is to help students learn how to read more closely and with an eye to possible outcomes. Much of the grading of the course then focuses on written products as either documentation of reading practice or as various kinds of outcomes. Everything is in words: sometimes presented orally, and even dramatically, and sometimes scribed. Small writing activities appear constantly throughout this course. They are typically graded for competence and then for excellence. They are worth a total of 30 percent. Participation in class activities and discussions is not simply a matter of being bodily present but of engaging actively, with excitement for the possibilities and respect for others\u2019 efforts. The 20 percent here should not be assumed but earned. The exam(s) in this course are designed to provide students with a timed writing activity, something which they will encounter repeatedly throughout their college education and in many other contexts as well. The exam(s) are worth 20 percent. The big writing project in this course, worth 30 percent, is graded as a portfolio that may include a proposal, a research report, drafts of various parts of the essay, as well as the essay itself. The project is itself divided up across a number of activities: first body paragraph, second and third body paragraphs, first draft, second draft, and final draft. (Yes, the process really is that involved.) Course Dynamics First, all students should read Rob Jenkins\u2019 essay on \u201cDefining the Relationship.\u201d Jenkins is also a professor of English at a regional state university in the south. His approach is similar to the one in this course. Discussion, completion of assignments, and participation in course activities are an important part of how I structure a course. I prefer not to lecture from any given book so that I can add to our discussion and not repeat material found elsewhere \u2013 if repetition is important to you, then this may not be the course for you. It should also be noted that course discussions, by design, are wide-ranging. I regard class meetings in the same light as most professionals: they are necessary and you must take notes no matter who is talking. (And it goes without saying that you deserve everyone else\u2019s respect, and they deserve yours.) An important part of participation is being in the room on time: every student is spotted three unexcused absences. Thereafter, each absence will remove up to ten percent of the final grade: this is in addition to null values entered for participation and missed assignments. Note-taking is your responsibility, as is keeping up with what is happening or happened in class on a given day or what is due in class following your absence. (Not handing in an assignment because you didn\u2019t know about it because you missed class and did not contact one of your classmates still counts as not handing in the assignment.) Please write down the name and contact information of at least one other member of this class. The university maintains a strict absence policy. If an absence is at all foreseeable, especially if it falls on a due date, you should let me know as much in advance as you can in order to find a solution. The same goes for arriving late or departing early. If you are more than five minutes late, you will not be admitted to class \u2013 unless you have a very good narrative and can perform it with a zeal glimpsed only in performances by Cirque du Soleil or Frank Sinatra. Turn off all sources of distraction before coming into class. Cell phones must be set to silent and put away, unless you are expecting an emergency telephone call, in which case you should talk to me before class starts and sit near an exit so that you can excuse yourself and step outside to take the telephone call. Let me state this again: no cell phones . [Simon Sinek has a good account][] of how cell phones satisfy us and, at the same time, keep us from the kinds of actions that lead to long-term things like relationships and satisfaction. All of you have a copy of the Code of Student Ethics. If you do not, please get one. All forms of academic dishonesty \u2014 e.g., cheating on exams, plagiarism in papers \u2014 will be taken very seriously in this class. At minimum, you will receive an F on the assignment, but there is also the possibility of receiving an F in the course or being dismissed from the university. I personally do not want to consider the possibility of turning over the design of a bridge that my family will cross to an engineer who cheats nor the diagnosis of a medical condition to a doctor who cheats. Many of you are from Louisiana and remain in Louisiana and thus will remain a part of my world: being surrounded by individuals whom I trust and admire is important to me. Please give me every opportunity to do so. Institutional Necessities One day, the University will create a central resource that collects stuff like this, but until then, they ask faculty to include things like this: Emergency Evacuation Procedures A map of this floor is posted near the elevator marking the evacuation route and \u201cDesignated Rescue Area.\u201d Students who need assistance should identify themselves to the instructor. Accessibility Services, Disability Services, & Other Helpful People The university maintains a wide variety of services and centers designed to help students who have either ongoing or emergent needs. Please don\u2019t hesitate to contact any of these folks, http://louisiana.edu/academics/academic-support-services , and don\u2019t be embarrassed to talk to me. Your Secret Identity In some semesters, each student is assigned a \u201csecret identity.\u201d The assignment is purely random: it consists of pairing your name with a some kind of token. Do not share your secret identity with anyone and do not ask anyone to share his/her secret identity with you. It is permissible, however, to design a game within which secret identities are used and thus disclosed. Be prepared for players to balk at anything that requires direct disclosure: your game must be compelling enough that revelation of their secret identity is something they are willing to \u201cpay\u201d in order to play. There is some reward for maintaining your secret identity throughout the semester. (Just some, not a lot.) Course Schedule This course, like all university courses, operates within the larger framework of the university\u2019s schedule, including various breaks and exam periods. Because each class is different, the schedule of assignments is not tied to any particular date but tied to a given sequence of events: Dangerous Games The first few weeks of the semester focus on the short story \u201cThe Most Dangerous Game\u201d (1924) and various ways to break up the text and the work associated with analysis.

The paper must be grounded in textual evidence and that evidence must be presented in a contextualized fashion and a considered sequence such that your audience is \u201cnaturally\u201d led from your initial proposition to agreement with your thinking on the matter. Just to be clear, the essay must be 3500 words, which does not include extensive quotations nor your works cited; it must be turned in on paper with one-inch margins, double-spaced, and in a reasonable 12-point serif type face. (If you aren\u2019t sure on any of these parameters, especially type face, check with me. Don\u2019t surprise me.) Your paper must be well-sourced, though I do not require any given minimum nor maximum number of sources.","title":115},{"location":"115/#course-logistics","text":"Meetings: MW(F) 11:00-11:50, HLG 122.

In a post on both my website and on Medium , I make an argument for taking notes by hand that essentially follows two paths: the first is the well-established research that has increasingly made it clear that when you take notes by hand you actually process more and get more out of notetaking. The second is the fact that not all of us are verbal thinkers and taking notes by hand opens up possibilities for taking notes in non-verbal ways: drawing, illustrating, even, sometimes, doodling. By the way, here\u2019s the most recent research on why taking notes by hand is better than typing notes: \u201cThe Pen Is Mightier than the Keyboard\u201d So now, with some luck, I have convinced you that taking notes by hand is not only required for this course but also the way you should proceed for all courses. How should this work? It is really quite easy. Start by grabbing yourself any notepad with a paper you like \u2013 yeah, paper matters, so if you like yellow paper or wide-ruled paper or whatever \u2013 then get it, because you\u2019re more likely to use something you like. If you can\u2019t find a notepad you like, then grab yourself a decent portfolio with a clip on it and use that \u2013 I use one that I found on Amazon because I sometimes use engineering paper when I am working on certain projects or A4 when I am working with European colleagues. (It\u2019s a wide world, full of interesting people: make sure you travel.) With that notepad or portfolio in your bag, you go from class to class, meeting to meeting, event to event, and you take notes. Each page has a decent header that will make it easier to organize later. Mine look like this: 2017-07-28: ENGL 115: 1 This tells me the date, the course/meeting/event, and the page numer. That\u2019s it. I can organize a day\u2019s worth of notes, weeks worth of notes, with this simple header at the top of each page. With a portfolio, you can simply use the pocket that most have as the place to stash the day\u2019s notes. With a notepad, you\u2019ll need to grab yourself some sort of folder \u2013 whatever you like, whatever holds up to how you work.

John Laudun, HLG 356, Tuesdays 9-12 & by appointment, laudun@louisiana.edu Description This iteration of the Introduction to Folklore course is focused on folk narrative. Participants in the course will encounter diverse definitions of and theories about narrative, examine various forms of narrative (with a focus on traditional genres of folklore), collect and document instances of folk narrative, and produce an analytical research report on those materials. Objectives Participants in this course will learn how to read scholarly and scientific definitions and analyses of human nature with a special emphasis on narrative and then apply those definitions or reproduce such analyses in their own thinking and writing. Writing is a significant component of any communication, be it scientific or professional, and participants in this course will be required to assume those voices necessary to accomplishing a particular task. In addition, as a course in folklore studies participants will also create documentation containing both metadata and data in appropriate markup, which may or may not include things like XML. Requirements As an upper-division course, this course assumes all participants are already familiar with accessing and using scholarly and scientific materials in both print and on-line forms. If not, then your first course of action is to schedule a library tour and/or take a tutorial. (See Resources for links.) It also assumes you are familiar with the University\u2019s Code of Conduct, and you are familiar with being an adult. This class is conducted as if we are are all professionals engaged in a mutually rewarding endeavor to which all of us contribute in order to succeed. That means coming prepared, not being distracted, and being engaged with not only the course materials but also each other. Running counter to the in loco parentis impulse of many other dimensions of the university, this course has a limited set of tasks with a grading framework that attempts to be as clear, and simple, as possible. For this semester, the overall schedule of graded assignments are: Assignment Value Informal Assignments & Pop Quizzes 10% of overall grade and 10 points each with the possibility may displace exams in importance (and percentages) Participation 20% of overall grade Exams 20% of overall grade Text Collection (This documentation be complete and recordings turned in and logged.) 25% of overall grade Research Report 25% of overall grade From the table, you can see that two most important outputs are the text collection and the research report. For the purposes of scheduling, it should be noted that the text collection is due at the beginning of April and the research report on the last day of classes. (This latter deadline is quite strict for reasons external to the course.) Texts A considerable amount of reading for this course are scholarly materials, mostly as PDFs, available either in on-line databases, like JSTOR, or through the course\u2019s Moodle site. Many of the materials in the latter instance are already uploaded, and so if there is a moment in the course where an item is listed on the schedule but does not appear in the Resources section of the course\u2019s Moodle page, please contact me. (Do not assume because you cannot find something that you are not responsible for it.) Please note that the list of books to be purchased is currently a work in progress.

Resources In addition to the texts we encounter in class, there are other resources both in folklore studies and in narratology that may be useful to those either in need of a bit more discussion or seeking to expand their understanding. JSTOR offers a variety of tutorials: some are simply slides or texts that you can read on your own and others are interactive tutorials hosted on their own Moodle setup. (Registration is required, but once you are registered, you\u2019ll discover a number of short videos as well as interactive exercises. If you allocate 20 minutes per session for a few days, you\u2019ll learn something.)

John Laudun, HLG 356, MW 2:30-3:30, Tuesdays 9:00\u201312:00, and by appointment. 482-5493 or laudun@louisiana.edu Description Someone once called Louisiana a \u201cfolklore land\u201d and we do live in a state, and in a region of the state, where folklore not only abides in abundance but is the subject of a great deal of attention by scholars and citizens, tourists and natives. This course encourages students to take a closer look for themselves not only at the folklore that surrounds and shapes each of us but also at the various ways it has been and is currently being represented. Taking a closer look requires participants to go out and see for themselves, engaging in field research in order to observe, document, and analyze folk culture as they experience and know it. While our chief focus will be verbal culture, we will explore other forms. Objectives Participants in this course will learn how to read scholarly and scientific definitions and analyses of human nature with a special emphasis on folk culture in general and narrative in particular and then apply those definitions or reproduce such analyses in their own thinking and writing. Writing is a significant component of any communication, be it scientific or professional, and participants in this course will be required to assume those voices necessary to accomplishing a particular task. In addition, as a course in folklore studies participants will also create documentation containing both metadata and data in appropriate markup, which may or may not include things like XML. Texts & Materials Required In addition to the book below, we will be reading a lot of articles available either through JSTOR, Project Muse, or through the course\u2019s Moodle website. All will be in PDF form, so please make sure you understand how to access and have also set aside money to print these materials. (We can discuss possible uses of devices, but phones are not among them. Don\u2019t even.) Lindahl, Carl, Maida Owens, and C. Ren\u00e9e Harvison. 1997. Swapping Stories: Folktales from Louisiana . University Press of Mississippi and the Louisiana Division of the Arts. Please note that all readings are sequenced/timed to make your understanding of particular lectures, discussions, or activities more profound and complete. Any and all materials found in the texts can, and will be, on any quiz or exam without necessarily having been directly addressed in class: if you have questions about anything you read, be sure to ask them in class. Other course expenses include equipment and/or supplies for recording and producing various kinds of documentary projects. (See the project specifications for more information.) Most modern devices are sufficiently general purpose in nature to provide the ability to make audio and/or video recordings of reasonable quality, but it may require some proficiency on your part to do so. If you currently do not possess that proficiency, please make sure to set aside the time to acquire it, and do be sure that you are comfortable establishing your own needs and shepherding your education according to your resources. (This assumption of your competence is a requirement of this course.) Recommended The books listed below offer a general background and some specific treatments of topics central to the study of south Louisiana\u2019s folk cultures. Their being listed here does not certify their accuracy. They are offered simply as possible reading for those interested in the ways Louisiana folk cultures have been examined in the past.

Requirements To meet the course objectives enumerated above, students must attend both in-class lectures and discussions, keep up with the readings, and engage in a semester-long research project of their own devising and execution. Thus, this course is best enjoyed when taken by independent, self-motivated learners. In addition, this course also requires a reasonable level of emotional maturity, since folklore is \u201cequipment for living\u201d and materials we examine and discuss come from life itself, where things can be inflammatory or embarrassing. Participants must be prepared for this. No, really: if you are easily offended, then this course may not be for you. Assignments PARTICIPATION & QUIZZES (20%). Regular participation means being in class (on time), prepared, and participating actively both through listening and through talking. No more than three absences will be excused without consent of the instructor. As noted above, the chief delivery vehicle for information in this course is in class.[^1] From time to time, to check for comprehension and currency, I give in-class quizzes, which are folded into your participation grade. Unlike the exams, which are scheduled in advance and can also be made up, quizzes are one-time-only affairs. Part of the participation and quiz grade are small assignments, like the one where you collect a single story early in the semester. Like the grades on quizzes, a check mark means you got credit. EXAMS (30%). There are two exams in this course, which cover materials from lectures, discussions, readings, and viewings. The purpose of the exams is for you to demonstrate to me and to yourself your knowledge and comprehension of the theoretical and historical material presented in class. PROJECT (50%). This course has at its core an individual research project which you propose, plan, develop, draft, and submit over the course of the semester. The final submission includes a paper of 2500 words of polished prose and the appropriate documentation, and recordings, for the material analyzed in the paper. For a complete description, see the project page . Agenda This topics and assignments in this class proceed in a sequence described in a separate document here . Emergency Evacuation Procedures A map of this floor is posted near the elevator marking the evacuation route and \u201cDesignated Rescue Area.\u201d Students who need assistance should identify themselves to the instructor. Contact Information Immediately look around where you are sitting and get the name and number of two responsible-looking people. Write that information below so that when you do have to miss class, you can contact them about what you missed. Contact: Contact: [^1]: Please note that I take roll for the first few weeks of class in order to learn your names, after that, you will often see me taking roll as class begins and/or making notes about someone who has made a contribution to class, a plus (+), or someone who is clearly studying for the exam in their next class, a minus (\u2013).

If you currently do not possess that proficiency, please make sure to set aside the time to acquire it, and do be sure that you are comfortable establishing your own needs and shepherding your education according to your resources.

Regular participation means being in class (on time), prepared, and participating actively both through listening and through talking. No more than three absences will be excused without consent of the instructor. As noted above, the chief delivery vehicle for information in this course is in class.[^1] From time to time, to check for comprehension and currency, I give in-class quizzes, which are folded into your participation grade. Unlike the exams, which are scheduled in advance and can also be made up, quizzes are one-time-only affairs. Part of the participation and quiz grade are small assignments, like the one where you collect a single story early in the semester. Like the grades on quizzes, a check mark means you got credit. EXAMS (30%). There are two exams in this course, which cover materials from lectures, discussions, readings, and viewings. The purpose of the exams is for you to demonstrate to me and to yourself your knowledge and comprehension of the theoretical and historical material presented in class. PROJECT (50%). This course has at its core an individual research project which you propose, plan, develop, draft, and submit over the course of the semester. The final submission includes a paper of 2500 words of polished prose and the appropriate documentation, and recordings, for the material analyzed in the paper.

The series\u2019 primary focus is on the effect of advances in science and technology on western society in its philosophical aspects. The title comes from the philosophical idea that the universe essentially only exists as one perceives it through what one knows; therefore, if one changes one\u2019s perception of the universe with new knowledge, one has essentially changed the universe itself. To illustrate this concept, James Burke tells the various stories of important scientific discoveries and technological advances and how they fundamentally altered how western civilization perceives the world.

Towards that end, each participant is responsible for contributing to the ongoing documentation of Louisiana folk culture. Each contribution must be focused on a particular form or practice possess the following dimensions: First, and foremost, it must be accessionable : you and the people whom you document must be willing to have the work done be a part of the public record. In the case of a great deal of material, this means it is publishable upon final submission. In the case of sensitive material, this may mean a delay in publication, waiting for the sensitivity to pass. This is something to negotiate between participants, the people they document, and the instructor. (It goes without saying that the work must also be verifiable by the instructor.) Second, the documentation must be consumable : if it a written text, it must be readable. If it is an audio work, it must be listenable. If it is a video work, it must be watchable. This means raw audio or video files with poor sound and bad lighting and no editing are not acceptable. Just as a text which is only a transcript or the description of an object is not acceptable. Which means, a contribution must be: Analytical and possess a point of view, making a clear case for why an object is not only interesting but also important in terms of understanding some aspect of Louisiana folklore. That means that anything that is the focus of a project must be: Traditional . While the world is filled with interesting people doing interesting things, and kooky people doing kooky things, folklore studies is not about the interesting nor the kooky: it is about the things we find so significant that we repeat them. Traditions can be, however, quite small. Families, even just nuclear families, can have sayings and stories that are an integral, or marginal, part of how they communicate with each other. But within any object, it is the temporal dimension that gives it depth. Specifications The project must be submitted both electronically and as a hard copy. Electronic copies may be documents created by Word or Pages or another word processor if submitted as RTF. Paper copies muct have one-inch margins, twelve-point serif type faces, single-sided, and high quality toner or ink. (Faded submissions will be rejected.) Documentation must be submitted electronically and audio files may be in MP3 or AIF format. (No WAV files, please.) Video files should be MP4. Logs should accompany recordings and can be in either Word, Pages, or PDF. The written document must be no less than 2500 words, of which 1000 words of transcription can be counted towards the total. That means 1500 words, or approximately 5 typed, double-spaced pages, must be your own description, analysis, and explanation of the material being treated. Transcriptions greater than 1000 words may be included, and, if done well, will certainly be factored into a project\u2019s evaluation. (So, yes, more is almost always better, but good more. More with good documentation and transcription and on topic, not random more.) Deadlines The final version of the project must be turned in during the last week of class, on a day specified by the instructor. Prior to that date, there will be a number of draft submission deadlines. Missed deadlines will be noted, and while no immediate penalty is assessed, no consideration will be granted to exceptional circumstances as later, or the final, deadlines occur. Guidelines There are a number of things to keep in mind when making field recordings, the most prominent of which is making the people with whom you work comfortable. Under the tight timeline of this course, this is most often family and friends for most participants, but it can also be workmates or other acquaintances \u2013 it is exceedingly hard to start an entirely new project from scratch and complete any documentation of note, let alone add any analysis within the scant few months of the semester. Additional dimensions of making someone comfortable is to record them in a environment with which they are familiar and under circumstances as close to the usual or the familiar as possible. When it comes time to record someone, make sure you have tested, and practiced with, your equipment. If you are using our phone, take time to record yourself talking in a room. Set it down on an oven mitt, or folded kitchen towel, as we have discussed and then sit in various places in relationship to the device to see how the microphone picks up different positions and distances. (You will also get a sense of what ambient noises it tends to pick up as well.) Make sure you know how to use the software, if you are using an iOS or Android device, and that the software is storing the recording some place from which you can later get it. Also make sure that you have enough room on your device to make a recording. That may mean letting the recording run for ten minutes and then seeing how much room the file it creates takes up. Multiply that number times 6 for a one hour session and times 12 for a two hour session. Does your device have enough storage room? (Make sure you turn a radio or television on so that if you are recording to a compressed format, the device has something to record.) The recording software for iOS and Android devices is an ever-changing landscape. Popular Science has some recommendations . The app that I have used on my iOS device is CaptureAudio . It has direct DropBox sync, which has been very reliable for me \u2013 obviously I wait until I have a wifi connection before I sync.","title":"Course Project"},{"location":"335/media/#course-project","text":"","title":"Course Project"},{"location":"335/media/#requirements","text":"The goal of this course is for participants not only to understand the nature of folk culture as it is situated in Louisiana but also to contribute to the documentation and broader understanding of folk culture.

Towards that end, each participant is responsible for contributing to our understanding of Louisiana folk culture by writing a 2500-word paper based on the documentation and analysis of folk narrative as captured on a recording which will also be submitted along with the proper documentation. Papers and records must possess the following dimensions: First, and foremost, they must be accessionable : you and the people whom you document must be willing to have the work done be a part of the public record. In the case of a great deal of material, this means it is publishable upon final submission. In the case of sensitive material, this may mean a delay in publication, waiting for the sensitivity to pass. This is something to negotiate between participants, the people they document, and the instructor. (It goes without saying that the work must also be verifiable by the instructor.) Second, the documentation must be consumable : written texts must be readable by general as well as specialist audiences. Recordings must be listenable. (If video, it must be watchable.) This means raw audio or video files with poor sound and bad lighting are not acceptable. In addition, please be sure that your paper has, in addition to the necessary background information about performers and their texts, an analytical dimension, making a clear case for why a text is not only interesting but also important in terms of understanding some aspect of folk narrative. That means that anything that is the focus of a project must be: Traditional . While the world is filled with interesting people doing interesting things, and kooky people doing kooky things, folklore studies is not about the interesting nor the kooky: it is about the things we find so significant that we repeat them.

Documentation must be submitted electronically and audio files may be in MP3 or AIF format. (No WAV files, please.) Video files should be MP4. Logs should accompany recordings and can be in either Word, Pages, or PDF. The written document must be no less than 2500 words, of which 750 words of transcription can be counted towards the total. That means 1750 words, or approximately 5 typed, double-spaced pages, must be your own description, analysis, and explanation of the material being treated.

Additional dimensions of making someone comfortable is to record them in a environment with which they are familiar and under circumstances as close to the usual or the familiar as possible. When it comes time to record someone, make sure you have tested, and practiced with, your equipment. If you are using your phone, take time to record yourself talking in a room.

Make sure you know how to use the software, if you are using an iOS or Android device, and that the software is storing the recording some place from which you can later get it. Also make sure that you have enough room on your device to make a recording. That may mean letting the recording run for ten minutes and then seeing how much room the file it creates takes up.

John Laudun, HLG 356, Tuesdays 9:00\u20132:30 and by appointment. Course Description Someone once called Louisiana a \u201cfolklore land\u201d and we do live in a state, and in a region of the state, where folklore not only abides in abundance but is the subject of a great deal of attention by scholars and citizens, tourists and natives. This course encourages students to take a closer look for themselves not only at the folklore that surrounds and swathes each of us but also at the various ways it has been and is currently being represented. Taking a closer look requires students to go out and \u201csee\u201d for themselves various aspects of Louisiana folklife \u2013 some of this will be fieldwork and some of this is simply participatory \u2013 but such activities are a requisite part of the course. Course Objectives This course is designed with three simple goals in mind: (1) that students possess a basic understanding of the scientific and historical contexts for understanding the cultures of southwest Louisiana, (2) that students engage in at least one documentary project which contributes to our understanding of the people who make up Louisiana, and (3) that students produce one piece of high quality documentary writing. Course Texts & Materials Ancelet, Pitre, Edwards. 1986. Cajun Country. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi. Ancelet, Barry Jean. 1994. Cajun and Creole Folktales: The French Oral Tradition of South Louisiana. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi. Gaudet, Marcia and James McDonald (ed). 2003. Mardi Gras, Gumbo, and Zydeco. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi. Other course expenses may or may not include admission fees to area folklife parks and/or supplies for recording and producing various kinds of documentary projects. The text books listed above offer a general background and some specific treatments of topics central to the study of south Louisiana\u2019s folk cultures. They operate in the background, with suggested readings timed to make your understanding of particular lectures, discussions, or activities more profound and complete. Any and all materials found in the texts can, and will be on any quiz or exam. Please note that in addition to the texts above, I am also experimenting this semester with the posting of a small collection of documentary films on our course\u2019s Moodle site. Some viewings will be required in advance of a particular class, so that we may focus our discussion in the wake of the viewing. Other viewings will operate as background material for our discussions, but do be aware that they will be on the exams. In all cases, these documentaries are copyrighted materials that we are allowed to use in educational contexts thanks to the Fair Use provision of the copyright laws. Do not under any circumstances copy these materials in any fashion. Doing so risks more pain, bad feelings, and perhaps legal penalties than any of us can imagine. All you need to do is find yourself a reasonably good network connection and the hour or so that viewing the video requires. Open your browser, click on the link, take notes. Nothing more. Course Requirements To meet the course objectives enumerated above students must attend both in-class lectures and discussions as well as view a number of materials made available to them as part of this class. This course is best when taken by independent, self-motivated learners. The materials we deal with come from life itself: there are often no clear-cut lines and, indeed, sometimes the materials themselves can be inflammatory or embarrassing. Assignments PARTICIPATION & QUIZZES (20%). Regular participation means being in class (on time), prepared, and participating actively both through listening and through talking. No more than two absences will be excused without consent of the instructor. As noted above, the chief delivery vehicle for information in this course is in class. From time to time, to check for comprehension and currency, I give in-class quizzes, which are folded into your participation grade. Unlike the exams, which are scheduled in advance and can also be made up, quizzes are one-time-only affairs. EXAMS (30%). There are two exams in this course, which cover materials from lectures, discussions, readings, and viewings. The purpose of the exams is for you to demonstrate to me and to yourself your knowledge and comprehension of the theoretical and historical material presented in class. Without that foundation, then much of the rest of the course will do you little good. FOLKLORE DOCUMENTATION (50%). This course has at its core a collaborative project: an encyclopedia of Louisiana folklore collected, compiled, and crafted by you. Some parts of it will be straightforward data entry. Other parts will be based on your own research. The nature of your contribution is to be decided in consultation with me and your fellow classmates. Emergency Evacuation Procedures A map of this floor is posted near the elevator marking the evacuation route and \u201cDesignated Rescue Area.\u201d Students who need assistance should identify themselves to the instructor. Contact Information Do not hesitate. Immediately look around where you are sitting and get the name and number of two responsible looking people. Not the cute man nor woman \u2014 because getting his or her number that way would be just creepy, but someone who has at least your level of maturity, if not higher. Contact: Contact: The Fine Print Much of the information to be gleaned from the formal instruction in this course is in the lectures I give, the discussions we have, and the documentaries we view. That means that attendance is foundational to a student\u2019s success in this course. What happens in any given class of this course cannot be found anywhere else. If you must miss a class, please contact one of the people whose names you entered in this syllabus for notes on what you missed. Additionally, it cannot be emphasized enough that this is a class in folk culture, which is typically learned, practically by definition, outside the sphere of formal instruction. This course is designed to provide, within the walls of the classroom, students with a basic grounding in the theory of folklore studies, the principle dynamics of most folk cultures, the history that informs Louisiana\u2019s folk cultural matrix, and particular examples drawn from particular Louisiana folk cultures. All of this will be foundational to your understanding and appreciation of either the folk cultures with which you grew up and/or in which you now find yourself immersed. No understanding will be complete without any experience of folk culture itself. A number of the activities in this class require students to interact with practitioners of a Louisiana folk culture. For most, this is typically family and friends, but it could be mean, for some, having to interview with individuals you know less well. Please be sensible in doing this. Because all experience unfolds across time, often a significant amount of time, students must be prepared to spend time outside of class, interacting with others in a thoughtful way that respects not only others but that this experience is a part of their own education. A lack of seriousness and a lack of respect for all involved \u2014 instructor, one\u2019s self, fellow students, folk practitioners \u2014 represents a failure to grasp the root ideas and issues of folklore studies and of this course. Students displaying a lack of respect will find themselves in conference with the instructor and then the dean of students. Part of taking yourself, your learning, and this course seriously is that you agree to all the rules and guidelines on academic honesty laid out in the Student Bulletin. Plagiarism and cheating in this course will result, at the very least, in failure of the assignment; it can also mean failing the course immediately and, potentially, expulsion from the university. If in doubt about what to do or how to handle material not your own in your work, please see me. Helping you to figure that stuff out is part of my job. While it is my profoundest wish that this course be a fun and exhilarating one, it is one which will require attention and effort on all our parts to be so. It is my privilege to teach this course, and I do my best to be as prepared as I can be for all eventualities. I expect the same of you. That said, part of our effort to have the best possible classroom experience is leaving other things outside: pagers, cell phones, food, drinks, materials for other classes, etc. Please turn off any and all of these devices before entering the classroom. If yours go off, you will be excused from class. You are, however, permitted to use a laptop computer for taking notes \u2014 do not abuse your time, my time, or UWIN surfing the web (again, you will be excused from class immediately) as well as an audio recorder. Please do note that I regularly incorporate a variety of copyrighted material within my lectures that may or may not be indicated in the course of a lecture, and that any remaining materials are copyrighted by me. By granting you permission to record lectures, I do so with the understanding that the recordings will only be for your use and only your use in the pursuit of your education. You may not share copyrighted materials with others. By the same token, I take your intellectual productivity and property equally seriously. Students who generate quality documentation of a person, place, event, or behavior are regularly encouraged to submit their materials to the Archives of Cajun and Creole Folklore. I may also ask a student for permission to retain a copy of your materials for use in future classes. I try to return materials in an orderly fashion, but time sometimes works against such efforts. Any and all materials belonging to you that are left in my possession at the end of the semester will probably be disposed in the first few weeks of the following semester unless you indicate otherwise \u2014 I simply don\u2019t have room to store all student materials forever in my tiny office. Course Schedule The schedule flexes in response to student interested, experience, and expertise. I have found in the past that when I posted a series of dates, that it confuses students when we either move more quickly or more slowly than those dates suggested we might. The best way to track this course if, first, to use your own notes, but you will also find that the lecture outlines posted on Moodle will give you a reasonable indication of where we have been and where we are going.","title":"Syllabus 2012"},{"location":"335/syllabus-2016/","text":"English 335: Louisiana Folklore Course Logistics Meetings: 11:00\u201311:50 MW(F), HLG 321 Instructor: Pr.

Course Description For better or worse, folklore in Louisiana has been and is subject to a great deal of attention by scholars and citizens, tourists and natives. This course encourages students to take a closer look for themselves not only at the folklore that surrounds and shapes each of us but also at the various ways it has been and is currently being represented. Taking a closer look requires students to go out and observe and document for themselves various aspects of Louisiana folklife and to participate in the expansion of the archeological/historical record of the region. Course Objective The goal of this course is for each student to produce one archive-quality piece of documentation of a traditional practice that occurs in Louisiana, or, in the case of historical practices, that used to occur in the region. Archive quality will be discussed in some detail in the course, but in this initial moment it includes, in addition to the item itself, which can be a text or an artifact, all appropriate and necessary documentation. The complete record will be ready to be uploaded into a digital archive by the end of the semester.

Course Requirements To meet the course objectives enumerated above, students must attend both in-class lectures and discussions as well as engage a number of materials made available to them as part of this class and engage themselves in a number of assignments outside of the classroom. Thus, this course is best enjoyed, and profited by, when taken by independent, self-motivated learners. This course also requires a reasonable level of emotional maturity, since folklore is \u201cequipment for living\u201d and materials we deal with come from life itself, where lines are often not clear-cut and, sometimes the matters with which we deal are inflammatory or embarrassing. Participants must be prepared for this. Intolerance will, as it were, not be tolerated. For more on what is required for this course, please see The Fine Print document. PARTICIPATION & QUIZZES (20%). Regular participation means being in class (on time), prepared, and participating actively both through listening and through talking. No more than two absences will be excused without consent of the instructor. As noted above, the chief delivery vehicle for information in this course is in class. From time to time, to check for comprehension and currency, I give in-class quizzes, which are folded into your participation grade. Unlike the exams, which are scheduled in advance and can also be made up, quizzes are one-time-only affairs. I take role for the first few weeks of class in order to learn your names, after that, you will often see me taking role as class begins and/or making notes about someone who has made a contribution to class, a plus (+), or someone who is clearly studying for the exam in their next class, a minus (\u2013). (You would be surprised how much one can see while standing in the front of the room.) EXAMS (30%). There are two exams in this course, which cover materials from lectures, discussions, readings, and viewings. The purpose of the exams is for you to demonstrate to me and to yourself your knowledge and comprehension of the theoretical and historical material presented in class. Without that foundation, then much of the rest of the course will do you little good. FOLKLORE DOCUMENTATION (50%). This course has at its core a collaborative project: an encyclopedia of Louisiana folklore collected, compiled, and crafted by you. Some parts of it will be straightforward data entry. Other parts will be based on your own research. The nature of your contribution is to be decided in consultation with me and your fellow classmates. Typically, the latter include interviewing someone about their life, collecting a recipe, collecting a number of a certain kind of genre, and/or photographing a house or collection of houses. e.g., 2011 August 14 (Sunday). Overheard in the bathroom at Green Room last night: (girl on phone) \u201cHey. What\u2019s up? Wait, you\u2019re drunk. Like, Mamou drunk.\u201d Emergency Evacuation Procedures A map of this floor is posted near the elevator marking the evacuation route and \u201cDesignated Rescue Area.\u201d Students who need assistance should identify themselves to the instructor. Contact Information Do not hesitate. Immediately look around where you are sitting and get the name and number of two responsible looking people. Not the cute one \u2014 because getting his or her number that way would be just creepy, but someone who has at least your level of maturity, if not higher. Write that information below so that when you do have to miss class, then you can contact them about what you missed. Contact: Contact: Course Schedule Kniffen, Fred. 1963.

Course Project Your goal for this course, for your term project, is to document an instance of Louisiana folk culture for yourself. Or, maybe, it would be better to think about it as just culture, and, even then, think about it as things people say and do every day. If you begin there, then in a dialogue with the rest of us, we can decide on what would be more significant and/or important to document and what would be less significant. The end result of your work will be both a report with a proper documentation of the text(s) and the context(s) within which it/they occurred. The context will be not only the immediate social context but also the larger cultural and historical context for the individuals involved, as we have seen already in a number of examples \u2013 and there will be more examples either discussed in class or posted on-line. The paper detailing all this particular information will be held in private in the archive of Louisiana folk culture that we are building together. The documentation of the text itself, and those dimensions of the context that can be properly abstracted so as to be useful to other/future researchers, will be in the form of a TEI document. For reference, a basic TEI version of the \u201cThe Spirit Controller and the Bull\u201d drawn from Barry Ancelet\u2019s Cajun and Creole Folktales would look something like this: TEI xmlns=\u201dhttp://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0\u201d> I went to meet an old man in Marrero, and he told me a story. He went to look for a treasure with some other men. And there was a controller who had brought a Bible to control the spirits. And when they arrived at the site, they saw a big horse coming through the woods with a man riding it, and when he dismounted, it was no longer a man on the horse. It was a dog. And he said the dog came and rubbed itself against his legs. He said it was growling. He said he knew the dog was touching him, but he didn\u2019t feel anything. It was like there was just a wind. And he said they all took off running. He lost his hat and his glasses and he tore all his clothes. And even the controller ran off and he never saw his Bible again after that. Considerably more elaboration is possible, and we will explore what elaborations are necessary and/or preferable as we work through your projects both individually and communally. I present this simple instance of TEI here for you to begin to become familiar, and comfortable, with it. Many of you have never seen the HTML that powers the websites on which you depend \u2013 try finding View Source in one of the menus of your browser. TEI is like HTML, in that it is a markup language in which a great deal of metadata can be supplied and acted upon. Another powerful markup language, of which some of you may have heard that developed as TEI developed, is XML. All of these markup languages depended upon extensive uses of tags that are marked by being inside angle brackets, < and >, that are usually paired, such that, as above, a tag that marks the beginning of a text, , is accompanied by one that marks the end, . None of this is hard in and of itself. What is challenging is the application of tags that are relevant to the material at hand. In most instances, these tags are analytical in nature, meaning they are the product of an analyst tackling a particular dimension of a text, and so what tags that are included in these documents will be a mix of those required and those you find interesting. An example of what a marked up text looks like can be found at TEI by example. The report and the TEI transcript are complementary as well in terms of requirements: shorter transcripts will require longer reports, and vice versa. Your goal for this project is some combination of documents that result in approximately 3500 words. Before you ask, yes you can go over, and the more you go over with reasonably good material, the higher your grade is likely to be. Like in the real world, high performance receives high marks. On Recording Equipment Because this is a class within a literature department, we are focused mostly on verbal texts. Other kinds of \u201ctexts\u201d are not off-limits, but they do, in having different dimensions, present different issues when it comes to data capture. While we must recognize that there is more to any text than simply its words and the vocal medium in which it is conveyed \u2013 that is, the linguistic and paralinguistic dimensions of a spoken text \u2013 it is also the case that written texts and audio recordings are much smaller in size than video recordings, and much easier to handle as a result. Software For most of us, the voice memo app that comes with most smart phones will do the trick, so long as your clear on how to get recordings off the device: in most instances, it should be fairly easy to email the recording to yourself, or, in the case of the Voice Memos app in iOS, to sync them to off-device storage. (iOS\u2019s Voice Memos will sync audio files to the Notes application, for example, which you should then be able to open on your Mac, provided you have a Mac and you have signed up for their iCloud service.) There are a lot of other sound recording apps available for smart phones. I have used a few, including both FiRe (Field Recorder) and CaptureAudio. I use the latter more often these days, but both are fine. I prefer to use dedicated audio recording apps because they allow you to choose the format in which you record your audio. Like almost all digital media formats, audio recordings come in both uncompressed, or \u201craw\u201d, and compressed forms. Most of you are familiar with, and indeed rely upon, a compressed format known as MP3. For my own fieldwork, when it is my research (and my reputation) on the line, I use an uncompressed format known as AIFF. See the note about CODECS below. Hardware Some of you may own and use, or have a friend or family member who uses, a dedicated camera, either a point and shoot or what is known as a DSLR. You are thus familiar with the idea that while the audio capture capabilities of your smart phone is \u201cgood enough\u201d for most purposes, it is not terribly good at it in particular. There are a couple of ways to improve this situation, and they involve purchasing additional equipment (or hardware). Microphones The simplest, and least expensive, option to enhance your audio recording capabilities is to purchase a microphone: almost any external microphone will be better than the one built into your smart phone, which, to be honest, wasn\u2019t chosen for the quality of its audio capture so much as its ability to fit into the small case of your phone and that it didn\u2019t cost very much. Please be careful when buying a microphone to purchase the appropriate cable that will link it to your device. Most professional recording equipment uses a grounded connection known as XLR, which is a three-prong connector. Most consumer devices, especially small devices, use an eighth-inch or \u201cmini\u201d jack with a TRS (Tip-Ring-Sleeve) or TRRS (Tip-Ring-Ring-Sleeve) arrangement for stereo audio input and output. (And do be aware that an XLR to mini-jack cable loses its grounded nature, which means that other electrical fields in an environment can affect your recording.) Recorders Moving away from using your smart phone, the next step you can take is to invest in a separate device. I generally advise against this for a couple of reasons: mostly because with a good microphone and a good audio recording application, your smart phone or tablet or computer is an awfully good portable sound studio and one you already own. (So, something you already own is good, and, perhaps just as importantly, something you already carry around.) For some, however, a separate device is preferable. Perhaps your phone is really old, or maybe it\u2019s already crammed full of data and apps \u2013 remember, using any device to capture data means you are going to increase your storage needs. Or perhaps you would just have a separate device to do this kind of thing. If that\u2019s the case, then I have a couple of suggestions to make. Let me begin with the device that I use, an Roland R-09 recorder, which is no longer available, but the Roland R-05 is, and it is cheaper and better than the R-09. Both units have built-in microphones that are better than most smart phones, and they are both lightweight and dependable. They both also use widely available standard batteries (2 AA) and SD cards. You can plug an external microphone, and you can also attach either device directly to your computer for transferring files via a USB mini cable. Smaller in size, and in price, than the Roland units and also widely popular is the TASCAM DR-05. The TASCAM DR-05 gives you much the same functionality and flexibility. Most people I know who use one don\u2019t even bother to use a microphone, but the unit does accept one. Both of these devices make it dead simple, thanks to their removable media, to move your audio recordings from the device itself to your computer. That\u2019s an important feature. Less expensive devices can sometimes make this more difficult. Here\u2019s a quick summary of other options: The Olympus voice recorders, like the Olympus VN-2700 for example, are very inexpensive and work well \u2013 but you must remember to turn off voice activation! \u2013 but getting the recordings off the device requires some work on the user\u2019s part. (And it\u2019s not a digital transfer but a matter of playing the audio into the computer.) The SONY ICD PX333 Digital Voice Recorder uses AAA batteries and removable media, but it only records in mono MP3 format. (That\u2019s an allowable option for this class, and for voice recording in general, but it is a limitation, and the Sony is a little more expensive.) The iGearPro Voice Activated Audio Recorder does allow you to turn the voice activation off, and it also allows you to connect the device directly to your computer in order to transfer files from the device. I have never used the MaxPro-Best USB Flash Drive Voice Recorder but it looks dead simple and it\u2019s very inexpensive. \ufffc PDFs must be printed out \u2014 the most recommended option because paper is rugged and lightweight \u2014 or available on a large tablet (a 10\u201d screen or larger) or laptop. Consulting a PDF on a smart phone is not an option. Not having the relevant text in class on the day it is to be discussed results in a lowered participation grade. Please budget/plan appropriately.","title":"Syllabus 2016"},{"location":"432/","text":"America in Legend English 432: American Folklore MW 1:00-2:15, HLG 202 Course Agenda Professor John Laudun HLG 356, MW 2:30-3:30, Tuesdays 9:00\u201312:00, and by appointment. 482-5493 or laudun@louisiana.edu Course Description The course is designed to introduce participants to the basics of folklore studies, both through an initial \u201cbootcamp\u201d as well as through ongoing readings \u2013 some as a focus for conversation, others as sidebars, and then to explore the way that America is socially constructed through stories we tell, sometimes to cheer ourselves on, and sometimes to scare ourselves silly. As an advanced course for undergraduates and a foundational course for graduate students, this course attempts to address folk materials and dynamics in terms of rhetorical effectiveness, literary/generic structure, and cultural history. Some students will be interested in the theory that will be used, albeit lightly, throughout the course, and non-folklorists interested in American literature and culture will find the historical dimensions critical to understanding certain genres/topics of American fiction. The goal of this course is to examine online, and offline, legends and understand the sources, both structural and referential, upon which they draw. Social media will be one of our foci, and as such this course highlights that media, first, has always been social, and that, second, the social world has always been mediated. Because of the personal nature of much of social media, participants in this course will need to have an open mind about the nature of meaning, and, just as importantly, about the varieties of human experience and perception. Much of the material in this course reveals the anxieties and fears, the prejudices and blindnesses, that humans too often carry with them and rarely communicate directly, only allowing them to slip out indirectly, in stories and assertions that manifest what are often tangled knots of things thought and/or felt. In some cases, the knots are not pretty. Course Requirements For matters of daily comportment and responsibility, please see The Essentials . Texts A great deal of the readings are scholarly in nature and will be available either as links to JSTOR and Project Muse or through the course\u2019s Moodle site, either as PDFs or as links to sites. In addition to the on-line materials, there are a few books required for this course. Those titles will be given to you within the first few weeks of classes. Expect to purchase between 2 and 4 books, so be sure to set aside a portion of your budget for that expense, in addition to the cost of printing other materials as needed. Assignments The assignment schedule for this course is simple: participation, exams, and a course project. Participation is worth 20% of your grade. Each of the exams is worth 15%; and the course project is worth the remaining 50%. Participation can be a source of confusion. Does it mean just showing up? Showing up is understood: an advanced course depends upon all of us being in the room (on time) and being prepared to discuss the topic at hand. A 400-level course in the humanities is not a data dump, but an opportunity to absorb new material, digest it, use it to analyze old and new points of information, and create new forms of knowledge that may be interesting or valuable to no one else but yourself. Active engagement with the materials, the topics, and others is requisite to achieve full marks in participation. The course project requires independent enterprise on the part of course participants, who are free to choose from a wide variety of topics, so long as they can make a case to me both in the intial proposal and in the paper itself that it fits within the scope of the course. The wide possible scope is on purpose, but negotiating the parameters of the project with the instructor is required . In order to encourage participants to take full advantage of the course\u2019s lengthy drafting process, half of the project\u2019s final grade, or 25% of the overall grade, is based on completion of the drafting process, which in many instances is no more than turning in the required items on time. Full credit, full stop. (Looking for a project? There\u2019s always 50 Hottest Urban Legends on Snopes .) Please note that this is an advanced undergraduate, foundational graduate course in the humanities: our focus is on texts. Please make sure that any work you turn in for evaluation is similarly focused. The exams are what they are, though they are sometimes replaced with take-home writing assignments to be completed by a specified deadline. Resources A lot of collections of \u201cAmerican folklore\u201d have been published over the years, each with its own assumptions about both \u201cAmerica\u201d and \u201cfolklore\u201d as well as what the purpose of such a collection should be. Typical of one kind of collection are those by Charles Skinner, whose Myths and Legends of Our Own Land reaches 9 volumes. A more synthetic, and more contemporary, reference can be found in the American Folklore: An Encyclopedia , edited by Jan Brunvand, a copy of which is available in the university library (Reference GR101.A54). While dated by contemporary scholarly perspectives, the collection of essays in Don Yoder\u2019s American Folklife (GR105.A6) is still quite useful, and foundational in many ways. In addition to reference works focused on the topic of American folklore, there are a myriad of other specialist reference works, many of which are available either in electronic formats or in the library for your use. Consider the following titles: The Greenwood Encyclopedia of African American Folklore , Encyclopedia of Asian American Folklore and Folklife , the Encyclopedia of Life Writing , The Greenwood Encyclopedia of World Folklore and Folklife are all the kinds of entry texts, being encyclopedias that will be familiar to your freshman/sophomore self but will also get your junior/senior/graduate self on the road to more serious and substantial work. That is, in addition to a synthesis/summary of a topic from a particular perspective, most scholarly encyclopedias also offer a small number of suggested readings. Please follow through on those readings the way you would a link on a web page. Institutional Necessities One day, the University will create a central resource that collects stuff like this, but until then, they ask faculty to include things like this: Emergency Evacuation Procedures A map of this floor is posted near the elevator marking the evacuation route and \u201cDesignated Rescue Area.\u201d Students who need assistance should identify themselves to the instructor. Accessibility Services, Disability Services, & Other Helpful People The university maintains a wide variety of services and centers designed to help students who have either ongoing or emergent needs. Please don\u2019t hesitate to contact any of these folks, http://louisiana.edu/academics/academic-support-services , and don\u2019t be embarrassed to talk to me.

Matters of \u201cFact\u201d As Wikipedia notes: The Day the Universe Changed is a British documentary television series written and presented by science historian James Burke, originally broadcast on BBC1 in [Spring] 1985 by the BBC [and rebroadcast on PBS in Autumn 1986]. The series\u2019 primary focus is on the effect of advances in science and technology on western society in its philosophical aspects. The title comes from the philosophical idea that the universe essentially only exists as one perceives it through what one knows; therefore, if one changes one\u2019s perception of the universe with new knowledge, one has essentially changed the universe itself. To illustrate this concept, James Burke tells the various stories of important scientific discoveries and technological advances and how they fundamentally altered how western civilization perceives the world.

Description Stories feature prominently in our lives and in discourses about our lives. Children ask parents to tell them a story; we swap stories as adults in order to get to know each other; and, increasingly, doctors and lawyers describe the work they do in terms of stories. This seminar is designed to familiarize participants with the wide range of scholarship and science that treats stories. Our goal will be to refine our own working definition of narrative both to understand its nature but also, for those interested in creative projects, to refine our practice. It should be clear from this description that this seminar is open to a wide range of interests: creative, literary, folkloristic, rhetorical, and linguistic. Instructor Pr. John Laudun. Office: HLG 356, 482-5493, laudun@louisiana.edu. Hours: Tuesdays 9-12 and by appointment. Texts Two texts, one classical and one synthetic, are listed below, but I hope to conduct much of the course through PDFs that are generally available (e.g., PLoS ONE), are available through a university subscription (e.g., JSTOR), or that I make available through the Moodle site. (The usual caveats to using Moodle apply: connections can be flaky; don\u2019t wait until the last minute to download an essay.) Herman, David. 2009. Basic Elements of Narrative . Wiley-Blackwell. (Please do not purchase until we decide to use this text.) Propp, Vladimir. 1968. Morphology of the Folktale . Tr. Laurence Scott. University of Texas Press. In addition to (or over and against) scholarly/scientific considerations of narrative, the seminar will develop its own corpus of texts which we will use as a place to apply theories and models, as a vehicle for furthering/deepening our discussion about various theories and models, and as a well from which we can draw our own ideas. For more on the corpus, see below . Requirements Participation Seminar participants are expected to comport themselves as, well, as if they were in a seminar: A seminar is, generally, a form of academic instruction, either at an academic institution or offered by a commercial or professional organization. It has the function of bringing together small groups for recurring meetings, focusing each time on some particular subject, in which everyone present is requested to participate actively. This is often accomplished through an ongoing Socratic dialogue with a seminar leader or instructor, or through a more formal presentation of research. The idea behind the seminar system is to familiarize students more extensively with the methodology of their chosen subject and also to allow them to interact with examples of the practical problems that always occur during research work. It is essentially a place where assigned readings are discussed, questions can be raised and debates can be conducted. (Thank you, Wikipedia.) Participation includes a wide variety of forms: active listening, thoughtful speaking, short presentations, involvement in in-class and out-of-class individual and group assignments. Some of these may include, as seems fitting for a seminar led by a folklorist, the occasional exploration of the world beyond campus in the form of observations you make in places like book stores, coffee shops, and other places where people gather to talk or read/write. There is no set list of assignments in this regard: this is something that must arise out of a sense of the seminar as a particular historical group of individuals. (Again, you would expect no less an assertion from a folklorist.) In addition to the assumed active participation, which includes a number of projects and/or assignments as well as active listening and talking, this seminar also requires the preparation and presentation of a conference paper ( >= 2500 words) and a seminar paper ( >= 7500 words). The idea behind this particular arrangement is that the conference paper will be due before the seminar paper, giving participants an advanced deadline that makes it possible to test the viability of an idea and to have time to expand the paper into something of consequence that we call the seminar paper and we often imagine as leading to an article. That is, both the written assignments in this seminar are designed to match conventional scholarly outputs. (We will have more to discuss \u2013 e.g., how sometimes expanding a conference presentation is harder than shrinking a research paper or what to do when a project implodes at the presentation stage \u2013 during the course of the seminar.) (See the project page for more information.) The weighting of grades will be as follows: participation in the seminar, which includes short in-seminar presentations and activities, makes up one half of a participant\u2019s evaluation. The conference paper and the seminar paper make up the other half. I hold out any weighting of the two for the following reason: it is entirely possible that the conference paper goes nowhere. If that is the case, first, good. Failure is one way to learn, and it is better to have a project blow up in the smaller form of the conference paper than to fall apart halfway through the seminar paper. Hence, should the conference paper go awry, it should matter less in any final evaluation. The same goes for the seminar paper. This is an educational setting: failure must be an option. (Not trying is not.) Corpus Because time is not infinite, each of you is constrained by a limit of 10,000 words: this can be one text or several. A further constraint is that we will need to balance our text between those items that are obviously or conventionally narrative and those which test boundaries. My somewhat informed guess is that many of you already have possible sources, which could range as wildly from the tried and true of Project Gutenberg or An Archive of Our Own to sites and sources which I cannot imagine. Just in case, here are some lists drawn from rambling around the \u201cintarwebs\u201d that might help you when you get stuck: Open Culture lists 800 Free eBooks for iPad, Kindle & Other Devices . ( Open Culture regularly compiles such lists, so it\u2019s worth searching for topics or titles that interest you to see what they may have already compiled in a \u201clisticle\u201d \u2013 Katherine Kinnaird and I got started on our work on TED talks thanks to an OC article about a list of the talks.) NothingintheRuleBook has 55 places you can download tens of thousands books, plays and other literary texts completely legally for free . Agenda Our own interests, expertise, and discoveries will determine more clearly how we will actually spend our time. For those reasons, I prefer to establish an agenda for a course, with the proviso that how much we dwell on a topic or gloss it will effect the timing of matters. While the sequencing of topics should remain fairly stable, the fulfillment of those topics through various readings will be determined by the content of our conversations. LINK . Resources The lists below are by no means comprehensive, only suggestive. If you find something that should be added here, please let me know. Journals Please note that the hyperlinks for JSTOR and Project Muse take you directly to the journal\u2019s main page and not the home page of those two services. The Journal of Narrative Theory appears to be the oldest journal focused specifically on narrative. Founded in 1971 as the Journal of Narrative Technique , JNT \u201chas provided a forum for the theoretical exploration of narrative in all its forms. Building on this foundation, JNT publishes essays addressing the epistemological, global, historical, formal, and political dimensions of narrative from a variety of methodological and theoretical perspectives.\u201d JNT is available on-line through Project Muse. Narrative is \u201cthe official journal of the International Society for the Study of Narrative. Narrative\u2019s broad range of scholarship includes the English, American, and European novel, nonfiction narrative, film, and narrative as used in performance art.\u201d The Society\u2019s website is: http://narrative.georgetown.edu/ . Online access to articles is available through Project Muse (2002-present). Issues prior to 2002 are available through JSTOR. Storyworlds is a new, interdisciplinary journal of narrative theory. It features research on storytelling practices across a variety of media, including face-to-face interaction, literary writing, film and television, virtual environments, historiography, journalism, and graphic narratives, studied from perspectives developed in such fields as narratology, discourse analysis, jurisprudence, philosophy, cognitive and social psychology, Artificial Intelligence, medicine, and the study of organizations.\u201d Current journal contents and contact information are available at http://storyworlds.osu.edu . The journal is available on-line on Project Muse. In addition to these journals focused narrowly on narrative, there are journals that address narrative specifically but from a particular perspective. Obviously most, if not all, of the journals with which you are familiar in the fields of composition, folklore, or literary studies will include narrative as part of their purview, but you may also want to take a look at a few other journals that you, perhaps, would not normally encounter, such as Discourse Processes or Genre . Special Issues In Autumn 1980, Critical Inquiry 7(1) released a special issue entitled simply: On Narrative. (URL: http://www.jstor.org/stable/i257724 .)

Agenda A Bayesian Introduction to Narrative Studies The first task in any course with some dimension of intellectual history as its focus is to try to understand the overall history of the domain. Narrative, however, is a relatively recent locus for organizing scholarly and scientific investigation. Prior to its development as a subject of study in the twentieth century, narrative was largely viewed through a lens of other objects \u2013 tragic plays, novels, myths. While a seminar of this nature could spend a considerable amount of time in the period prior to the formalist-structuralist articulation of narrative as an object in its own right, we are going to bounce around a bit, hoping, in some shadow of Bayes, to locate ourselves through apparent random pings in the great depths of intellectual history. We begin with two readings, one a narrative, and one a scholarly examination: McConnell, Richard. 1924. The Most Dangerous Game. Collier\u2019s . [Moodle]. For those interested in the sheer volume of adaptations of the story, the Wikipedia entry for the short story has a decent, if not complete (because impossible), list. Schiffrin, Deborah. 2009. Crossing Boundaries: The Nexus of Time, Space, Person, and Place in Narrative. Language in Society 38 (4): 421\u201345. DOI:10.1017/S0047404509990212. JSTOR . Burke, Kenneth. 1973/1941. Literature as Equipment for Living. In The Philosophy of Literary Form , 293-304. University of California Press. [Moodle]. Finally, before we leap into our own exploration of the development of narrative studies, it won\u2019t hurt to read some surveys and develop some sense of the larger landscape. For this, there are two encyclopedias, one you know and one you are less likely to know. The first entry for \u201cNarratology\u201d is in Wikipedia , and the second in the Living Handbook of Narratology . The former is short; the latter long. Unitizing Narrative: Motifs & Functions Before we examine Propp\u2019s work, it\u2019s important to understand the larger dialogue in which he is engaging. Specifically, early in Morphology , Propp notes that \u201cthe study of the tale has been pursued for the most part only genetically, and, to a great extent, without attempts at preliminary, systematic description\u201d (5). Genetic references the great philological collection projects of the nineteenth century that were, for the most part, focused on origins and originals. In the twentieth century, that focus would become what is now known as the historic-geographic method, and its most noted accomplishment are the great indices of folklore studies: the tale-type index and the motif index. The best way to understand them is to use them. (More on genetic matters below.) The Indices The Aarne-Thompson-Uther classification system is available on-line as part of the Multilingual Folk Tale Database . A concise explanation of the ATU system is offered here . In preparation for actually using the two iconic folklore indices, I would suggest the following reading: Again, Wikipedia is not a terrible place to start. And there are two other online sources that are worth your time: Richard Kuehnel and Rado Lencek. What is a Folklore Motif? How to use Thompson\u2019s Folklore Motif Index This seminar would be remiss if you did not read about the idea of motif from the compiler himself, Stith Thompson. I have also included Angela Maniak\u2019s short introduction to the role of the role of indexes, or indices, and bibliographies in classical forms of scholarship for those less acquainted with them. Finally, the long essay by Dan Ben-Amos is for those committed to understanding the nuances of folklore studies\u2019 intellectual history. Thompson, Stith. 1949. Motif. In Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology and Legend , 753. Eds. Maria Leach and Jerome Fried. Funk and Wagnalls. [Moodle]. Maniak, Angela. 1983. Bibliographies and Indexes in American Folklore Research. In Handbook of American Folklore, ed. Richard Dorson, 447-451. Indiana University Press. [Moodle]. Ben-Amos, Dan. 1980. The Concept of Motif in Folklore. In Folklore studies in the Twentieth Century: Proceedings of the Centenary Conference of the Folklore Society, ed. Venetia Newall, 17-36. Rowman and Littlefield. [Moodle]. A slightly different approach to unitizing narrative, but proceeding along the same lines as the historic-geographic school, can be found in the work of Jamshid J. Tehrani , who has parsed narratives into traits that look a lot like motifs and then attempted phylogenetic analysis on variations on a text to see which are more closely related. His analysis takes place against a backdrop of history and cultural geography. Gra\u00e7a da Silva, S. & Tehrani, J. J. 2016. Comparative phylogenetic analyses uncover the ancient roots of Indo-European folktales. Royal Society Open Science 3(1): 150645. DOI: 10.1098/rsos.150645. URL Tehrani, J. J. 2013. The Phylogeny of Little Red Riding Hood. PLoS ONE 8(11): e78871. DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0078871. URL . Propp The intertwined, and yet not intersecting, history of motifs and functions is not one on which I can comment. Structuralists outside folklore studies never took up the motif, and folkorists, while fascinated with function, never developed the idea much. Propp\u2019s Morphology, however, has enjoyed a renaissance of late. (It is perhaps because the kinds of data and analysis needed for structuralism has finally come to be \u2013 see Miranda for more.) Propp, Vladimir. 1968. Morphology of the Folktale . Tr. Laurence Scott. University of Texas Press. [Moodle]. And here are some Louisiana legends to consider. (For a text analytical perspective, the corpus is also on Voyant-Tools ) Contemporary considerations of Propp include: Fisseni, Bernhard, Aadil Kurji, and Benedikt L\u00f6we. 2014.

Computerizing Propp\u2019s Morphology: A Forward-Thinking Retrospect on Structuralism. New Directions in Folklore 13(1/2): 3-43. [Moodle]. The motif is one of those things that seems old-fashioned and yet has renewed interest in the era of data science (for a variety of reasons). In computer science, Mark Finlayson has done some remarkable work \u2013 see his profile page for a complete bibliography \u2013 but those works directly related to Propp are below. (Please note that computer science, like the sciences in general, is really good about making their work easily accessible: the obsession with tying any work up with protections is the best path to obscurity, literal and figurative.)

The Other Structuralism For those familiar with Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, it might surprise you to learn that while his early work on kinship had established him in the academy, his rise to star status actually emerged from his memoir, Tristes Tropiques , published in the same year, 1955, as \u201cThe Structural Study of Myth\u201d (below). The essay was one stepping stone \u2013 others are collected in Structural Anthropology \u2013 to his longer treatment of myth in La Pens\u00e9e Sauvage (1964, translated as The Savage Mind in English, which, as is usual for translations of Levi-Strauss, and later Derrida, misses the linguistic play often at the heart of his writing).

Classical Narratology While we will return to the idea that narratives are a distinct form of discourse, or a particular mode of discursive production, if you prefer, Barthes\u2019 \u201cIntroduction to the Structural Analysis of Narratives\u201d captures some of the spirit of one of the pivotal moments in the shaping of narrative as a subject of study and will, for many participants, give some hint of what the formalist-structuralist paradigm looks like. Barthes\u2019 \u201cIntroduction to the Structural Analysis of Narratives\u201d first appeared in Communications 8 in 1966. (We are reading the translation published in NLH in 1975. Another translation (into English) can be found in Image Music Text , published in 1977.) Communications was a pathbreaking French journal, and this issue featured essays by Greimas, Bremond, Metz, Todorov, and Genette, all of whom were well on their way to becoming some of the more important figures in structuralism and/or narrative studies. They are typically grouped together for their combined debts to a variety of sources which are easily confused for readers otherwise unfamiliar with the broader intellectual history of the twentieth century. Greimas et al. drew upon structural linguistics (as articulated by Saussure and Benveniste), the Prague School (most notably the work of Roman Jakobson), Russian formalism (particularly Propp but also Bakhtin, Medvedev, among others), structural anthropology (as advanced by Claude Levi-Strauss but also found in the work of Mauss).

Outside the Tower One of the reasons for this course is the immense amount of discourse focused on stories and storytelling that takes places outside the academy. Some of it, as we have seen, is just that story is the current buzzword, much like paradigm and/or box were in a previous moment. There is, however, a lot of very smart thinking about the shapes of stories taking place. TVTropes is one venue, but writers, readers, and critics of genre fiction also have some very interesting, and often quite compelling things to note about the nature of narrative. One place to start is this analysis of the final battle in the middle movie of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, aka Helms Deep. The Nerdwriter\u2019s analysis includes the notion of beats , something you will find used elsewhere.","title":"The Shape of Stories"},{"location":"531/agenda/#the-shape-of-stories","text":"Return to syllabus .","title":"The Shape of Stories"},{"location":"531/agenda/#agenda","text":"","title":"Agenda"},{"location":"531/agenda/#a-bayesian-introduction-to-narrative-studies","text":"The first task in any course with some dimension of intellectual history as its focus is to try to understand the overall history of the domain.

Barthes\u2019 \u201cIntroduction to the Structural Analysis of Narratives\u201d first appeared in Communications 8 in 1966. (We are reading the translation published in NLH in 1975. Another translation (into English) can be found in Image Music Text , published in 1977.) Communications was a pathbreaking French journal, and this issue featured essays by Greimas, Bremond, Metz, Todorov, and Genette, all of whom were well on their way to becoming some of the more important figures in structuralism and/or narrative studies. They are typically grouped together for their combined debts to a variety of sources which are easily confused for readers otherwise unfamiliar with the broader intellectual history of the twentieth century. Greimas et al. drew upon structural linguistics (as articulated by Saussure and Benveniste), the Prague School (most notably the work of Roman Jakobson), Russian formalism (particularly Propp but also Bakhtin, Medvedev, among others), structural anthropology (as advanced by Claude Levi-Strauss but also found in the work of Mauss).

There is, however, a lot of very smart thinking about the shapes of stories taking place. TVTropes is one venue, but writers, readers, and critics of genre fiction also have some very interesting, and often quite compelling things to note about the nature of narrative.

You will note that each text is one big blob of text. That\u2019s my doing. When I first set up this collection, I deleted all the line returns because I had not yet mastered how to remove them when I was working with them in code. I now know how to do that, and I am in the process of adding back the line breaks, which were, by and large, by clause. So, the second text would look like this: I went to meet an old man in Marrero, and he told me a story. He went to look for a treasure with some other men. And there was a controller who had brought a Bible to control the spirits. And when they arrived at the site, they saw a big horse coming through the woods with a man riding it, and when he dismounted, it was no longer a man on the horse. It was a dog. And he said the dog came and rubbed itself against his legs. He said it was growling. He said he knew the dog was touching him, but he didn\u2019t feel anything. It was like there was just a wind. And he said they all took off running. He lost his hat and his glasses and he tore all his clothes. And even the controller ran off and he never saw his Bible again after that. To assemble all the texts into a single file, I used a command line utility called tail which displays the contents of a file with regard to line numbers. In the case of the command below, I told it to start with the first line, a rather long tail: tail -n +1 *.txt > ../all.txt I tell it to take all the text files, *.txt in the current directory and write the output to a new file, all.txt in the next level up directory \u2013 in this case it was my desktop. The advantage of using tail over cat \u2013 a utility which con cat enates files \u2013 is that tail automatically separates the compiled files with the name of the file from which the content was drawn. In the case of the file above, that looked like this: ==> anc-089.txt <== Because I wanted things to look nicer for you, I decided to convert the file names into markdown-style headers so that I could use markdown to convert the files to HTML. To do that, I first chopped off the part of the file name I didn\u2019t need plus the right-hand side of the division marker: .txt <== and replaced it with ## , which is the other side of the Heading 2 markup in markdown, but it could just as well have been nothing. Having done that, I replaced the lefthand part of the divider, ==> with the beginning of the markdown indicator for a second level heading, ## . Again, a Replace All in a text editor and we are done. Then we run the completed document through a markdown implementation, converting it to HTML, and apply a cascading style sheet we already have lying around and presto! What follows are 27 folk narratives collected by Barry Ancelet (ANC), myself (LAU), Lindahl, Owens, and Harvison (LOH), and a number of my students (ULS). The Legends anc-088 In Charenton, north of Lake Charenton, there was an old Indian named Jim. And they asked old Jim where might be a certain marked oak tree north of the lake. And old Jim said he knew. So they went. They started digging. And as soon as they had dug a ways, there was a great big bull that came through the woods with flames coming out of his nose. So it passed. And it just touched the shovel of the man who was digging, and all of them got away. So as soon as the man looked, all the others were gone. So he left, too. And the man told the Indian, \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u2018\u2019I\u2019ll have to go back to town for a spirit controller.\u201d So he said, \u2018\u2019I\u2019ll be back.\u201d So some time later, he came back but it was during the time of the vigilantes, you know, the Ku Klux Klan. And his wife thought they were the ones who wanted to talk to him. So his wife didn\u2019t want him to go with them. So the spirit controller said to the Indian, \u201cWill you give us your share?\u201d And the Indian said, \u201cYes, go ahead, you all can have it.\u201d So they went. So some time later, the Indian said to my late father- He was going through the woods not far from there. So he decided he would go north of the lake to see, you know. The hole was there, and the chest, and the markings of dollars were on the wood that they have broken off of the chest. So they had found it. The spirit controller had done it. It must be that he controlled the bull, the fire-breathing bull. But they said the flame was coming out of its nose and they could hear it coming through the woods. They heard the wood cracking, you know, when he jumped. The louder it cracked, the closer he came, until he was right next to them. anc-089 I went to meet an old man in Marrero, and he told me a story. He went to look for a treasure with some other men. And there was a controller who had brought a Bible to control the spirits. And when they arrived at the site, they saw a big horse coming through the woods with a man riding it, and when he dismounted, it was no longer a man on the horse. It was a dog. And he said the dog came and rubbed itself against his legs. He said it was growling. He said he knew the dog was touching him, but he didn\u2019t feel anything. It was like there was just a wind. And he said they all took off running. He lost his hat and his glasses and he tore all his clothes. And even the controller ran off and he never saw his Bible again after that. anc-090 Mom said that they used to dig a lot for money. Lots and lots of money was taken out of the ground like that. And she said that her little brother had gone in the woods to get the cows. And he stayed longer than he was supposed to stay. So his mother spoke to him, and she wanted to know where he had been. So he said he had seen a little tomb in the woods. And he said there was a pile of leaves on the grave. And he had cleaned the tomb and he had danced on it. So he had had fun on this little tomb in the woods. \u201cWell,\u201d she said, \u201cif you did this, come and show me where it is.\u201d He went, but they were never able to find the place. anc-091 I know them well. There was Jesse Venable. That was their father. Oh yeah, they saw that often there. There were two buckets. One each end of the chain, you see. When you raised one, the other one went down. You could get water that way. Well, they went all by themselves there. Water flew out and splashed against the side of the big well, a square well. Oh yeah. There are some who claim that there was gas in the ground, but no. That wasn\u2019t it because they saw other things. Heard huge echoes as though the earth had split. They would go outside and there was nothing to see. There wasn\u2019t money buried there? Supposedly. That\u2019s what they said. The oak tree had been transplanted to indicate the place, mark the place. Where the money was. Many went to look for it. They looked often, but they couldn\u2019t find it, but they saw things. Oh yeah. This was true. I lived nearby for years, maybe twenty years, right next to that place. lau-013 One day \u2026 my family was kind of weird. Because they would always try to dig for money. So one day \u2026 I was young, about twelve I guess. So my mother \u2026 couldn\u2019t leave me home, had to take me out there. So we went out there, to a place called the country, some property we had out there, about an acre of land. So they said form a circle. And this is \u2026 my eyes seen this myself. We formed this circle, man. My brother, my brother was preaching. He was digging in the middle. We were all around him and he was digging in the middle. Man, he took that shovel. I guess from the way it looked it must have been a shovel deep, about like this. Something went yanga yanga yanga yang. And then went boom. And when you looked again, they had a fucking coffin, man. Solid gold. Open it up, nothing but coins in there. And then a bull appeared, just appeared out of nowhere. The bull had fire coming out his nose and his eye was red red red. And you hadn\u2019t supposed to talk, because it would break the chain of everything. That\u2019s just how it was. That bull started charging. I was trying to get out of there. I\u2019m young. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. My mother telling me just don\u2019t move. There ain\u2019t nothing, ain\u2019t nothing. You just seeing things. And that sucker come up from me to like where I\u2019m sitting to you and disappeared. Now you know that scared the shit out of me. I was damn near shitting in my clothes. My uncle come up in the car. And when he drove in the yard that shit exploded. And when I looked again it didn\u2019t look like anyone had dug in the ground at all. Everything disappeared. lau-014 Like I said my family was weird, they liked to dig for money and stuff. Said my grandfather had left us some money, and they was digging for it So one day we went, and I was at work, so I can see, we at a country spot, like our property. So I can see a lot of people dressed in white. So I\u2019m curious me. I said well shit what the hell is everybody doing out there dressed in white? I wanna see. So I goes out there. So they tell me you\u2019re working right now, just go home come back. You know, come back after work. So I goes back, man, after work. So, they all in the house. We all praying man, everyone\u2019s on their knees praying. They got an excavator in the back yard, digging. You understand? Find this money, I guess. We\u2019re on our knees, man, we\u2019re praying. It\u2019s like in the pit of the summer like here. No wind nothing. They had a wind come through the house. That wind was so strong: my aunt was holding onto the door like that and both her legs was in the air. That\u2019s how strong the wind was. In the house. So they said \u2014 they picked me, my nephew, the one I was telling you that talk all that shit, and my little niece to go bring some water to the workers in back, the one that was doing the work. So we got to walking. We passed on the side of the house to bring them. So my nephew said, say man you see that guy in the tree? I said man fuck I don\u2019t see nobody in no tree. He said yeah man he be right there sitting on that limb. I said I don\u2019t see nobody man. I\u2019m getting scared now. Man I don\u2019t see nobody. But he\u2019s seeing this, you know. So he said \u2014 I said how he look? It\u2019s a guy, he said, it\u2019s a guy dressed in a pirate suit, man. He said he got a pirate hat on. He got a pirate jacket. And he started talking to him. The guy in the tree started talking to him while he\u2019s telling me this. But the guy in the tree is tell him shut up don\u2019t tell me that. So he telling me, man, look he right there. You can\u2019t see him? Look he right there on that branch. He say he want something more to drink You know, because what they had did: they\u2019d put a bowl in the back yard, under this tree, with some alcohol in it. You understand? And I don\u2019t know if it was the sun that would dissolve it, but it would be gone. Okay, so he say he say man he want another drink. So I said fuck man don\u2019t tell me that. I wanna get back in the house. I said I don\u2019t see nobody up there. So we kept on walking. We went out there. We brung them some water. So on our way back. Look at him. He say, see you, you son of a bitch. He say you don\u2019t wanna give me another drink, huh? He say you gonna be just like me. He say you see this here peg leg? He say you going to be just like me. He say for this out here y\u2019all are going to have to lose something. So, man, it got kind of scared. We started walking fast. By the time we got to the house, I broke out a run. A shovel, man, come from the back of the house. I mean full force. That shovel stuck in that tree so deep we had to dig it out with an axe. It stuck \u2014 you know with a shovel, it\u2019s hard to stick a shovel into anything. That shovel went inside the tree halfway. loh-157 The man whose story I\u2019m going to tell you as far as I know actually lived, because I played around his grave a lot. He was buried, still buried, where we lived. He was buried in the yard where I lived. They had built a cypress picket fence around it. By the time I was old enough to know anything, the picket fence was falling apart. But it was still intact, partially. This was a guy by the name of Fisher, which is obviously not a Cajun name. Supposedly Fisher and his wife and Fisher\u2019s wife\u2019s son, whose name was Billy, came to live in that house. Where they came from, nobody knows. The story is, and this is rumor and speculation, that he was a bank robber. He had moved into that house to sort of disappear. He was a drunk. Every time he\u2019d go to town, he\u2019d get drunk. This would have been Church Point, the closest town. He\u2019d go on horseback and go to town and come back drunk and beat up on Billy. One afternoon he came back drunk and Billy shot him. Killed him. His wife and Billy buried him right there. That night as it was dark, they left in the buggy, supposedly with a lot of gold. They came up to Jean Jannise Jr.\u2019s house. This is not the loup garou, this is his son, who was living \u2013and the house is still there, not the house but the place. When they got there, she looked upon Jean Jr. as a reliable man. She stopped there right after dark. It\u2019s always after dark! He told her, \u201cIf you try to cross this forest at night, you\u2019re going to be robbed. Why don\u2019t you stay here tonight and tomorrow you can go.\u201d Supposedly she was returning to Mississippi. That night, supposedly, she buried her money on the other side of Jean Jr.\u2019s house, a lot of gold. Tremendous amount of gold. She never returned so the gold is still there. I had a friend of mine who told me that was true because all drunks have a lot of money to bury! And that\u2019s my reaction to that story. loh-158 There was so much Lafitte activity here, then legend glorified it. Then Texas picked up on it at Galveston. There\u2019s a lot of stories. In the little town of Duson over near Lafayette, on Highway Ninety near Lafayette, you\u2019ll notice there\u2019s a little Catholic church on the left side of the road when you\u2019re coming this way, just a little out of town. There\u2019s a man named Judice who was very active in public affairs. He had a man plowing his field and the plow hit something. They opened it up and it was a big chest full of jewels and gold coins. All of them had early dates, and there were French coins and early American coins. They were buried there. They said it was Lafitte. They don\u2019t know who it was. But this negro man who found this built the Catholic church and the school there with part of the money. Seven years later, I guess jealousy, it burned down. He rebuilt it. Seven years later, it burned down again. He rebuilt it again. How much he had left I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s one case, and there\u2019s well-established fact on it. loh-159 Where Hodges Gardens now is, my Dad was hauling pine knots. They used to fire these locomotives, these trains. The locomotives would pull the log engines. They fired them with pine knots. He was hauling that stuff and selling to the railroads. He was working oxen. He stopped at a little branch to water his oxen, saw something glittering in the water, went to pick it up and it was a gold brick. A gold brick. Now, that was a bullion. These Mexicans would mine it (gold) and make it into little bricks. Now, the way he described it. I was too young to remember it. I was a baby at the time. He described it, like, it would have been like a small Hershey bar the way he described it. Well, him and his brother, they went down the little branch digging and hunting to see if there was any more. But they never could find any more. He put it over the door facing, and he\u2019d show it to everybody that came in. One day, he went to show it to someone and it was gone. Somebody had put it in their pocket while he wasn\u2019t looking, and he lost it. Now, he [his father] had a cousin that found a gold . . . It was not a bar; it was some kind of medallion. They said it was hexagon shaped and had Spanish writing on it. He did about the same thing. Some guy was gonna send it off and see what it was worth, and that was the end of it. That\u2019s why I\u2019m not a rich man today; my relatives didn\u2019t hang on to their money! loh-160 I was in Leesville one day, in the grocery store, and a man told me, said, \u201cYou ought to talk to my dad. He\u2019s got a very interesting story he can tell you.\u201d I said, \u201cI want to talk to him, by all means.\u201d So I went to see him, and he is a man by the name of Smith. They own the Piggly Wiggly store in Leesville. There\u2019s two of the brothers. I don\u2019t know if it was John, who is a state representative, John Smith, or if it was his brother. One of them told me about it. One of them told me to go see their dad. So Mr. Smith told me, he said that his grandfather, a man by the name of Brock, originally lived in Marthaville, Louisiana, in Natchitoches Parish. He had moved to the Rio Grande valley and was a farmer. This was along about 1912. There was a bandit by the name of Pancho Villa. He would come across the river and raid farms in Texas. Finally, well, for years they were trying to get the federal government to do something about it. They were pretty slow to react to it. He finally went up to Columbus, New Mexico. Killed a lot of people up there and done a lot of damage. They sent General Pershing. Later on, he was a famous World War I general over in Europe. He never did catch Pancho Villa, but he got close enough for Pancho Villa to decide he better stay out of the United States. Run him back across the river. But back to my story, he raided a farm next to Mr. Brock\u2019s. I suppose he probably killed some people, took what valuables they had, gold or stock. Scared Mr. Brock up pretty bad, and he decided he\u2019d just leave. Get out of there if that\u2019s the way it was gonna be. So he was packing up to come back to Marthaville, and there was an old Mexican on his place. Come to him and says, \u201cMr. Brock, I\u2019m gonna give you a map where you can dig up some money when you get back to Louisiana.\u201d Well, I stopped Mr. Smith right there and I said, \u201cNow, look, why didn\u2019t the Mexican go dig it up?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, he was an alien. He was not an American citizen. In those days, a law officer would just shoot one down.\u201d Mr. Brock came on back. In the spring of the year, he was making a crop. He had two grown boys to help him. They were after the old man, \u201cLet\u2019s go dig up the money. Let\u2019s go dig up the money.\u201d He was afraid they wouldn\u2019t get the crop in. But after the crop was laid by in the summertime, he said, \u201cAlright boys, we\u2019ll go see about it.\u201d So they went straight and dug up. There was a little cave. They dug the money up. It was twenty thousand dollars in silver. No gold. Mr. Smith told me, \u201cI took my grandfather back there several times. He wanted to go see where this money was dug up, so I took him there several times.\u201d I asked him, \u201cWell, would you take me and show me where it was?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll try. It\u2019s been a long time.\u201d Understand that they have straightened that road out. It used to have terrible curves. So we got over there. We went up there. It got pretty close to the place, and he said, \u201cIt\u2019s somewhere. I know it\u2019s over here somewhere.\u201d We went about a mile or two and he said, \u201cWe went too far.\u201d We never could locate just where it was, but he said, \u201cIt\u2019s right in here on this ridge.\u201d He said that these two uncles came in later and used dynamite, hoping to find some more. But they didn\u2019t find any more. There was an outlaw by the name of West. I believe, the best I remember, he might have rode with Murrell. He might have been in Murrell\u2019s gang when he was young. I think he was a Civil War veteran. I think he fought in the war. But he built him up a good little gang. But they were terrible as far as being heartless. Throw people in wells! Just let \u2018em starve to death! Killing babies, all kinds of stuff. West was the outlaw that did that (buried the money), according to the Mexican. He was with West and remembered it well enough to draw that map loh-161 I\u2019ll tell another little story. A friend of mine told me this story. She was raised down here on Toro Creek, just off of one-seventy-one Highway. She said that, I knew that there was an old stage coach route that came through where Hodges Gardens is now, just west of this Toro Church we were talking about. I didn\u2019t know that they had an old stage station over there. Nobody ever told me that. If they did, I\u2019d forgotten it. But she said there was an old stage station right close to where they lived. It was just off the road going to Toro Church. She went to church there when she was a girl. She said one day, one Sunday, they were going to church. There was a bunch of guys in a car, stopped over there, had shovels with them and everything. They stopped and asked them if they had trouble and could they help them. \u201cWhat are you doing in the country, on a country road?\u201d They told them that no, they had car trouble, but they had it fixed. So they went on to church. When they came back after church, the kids went out to the old stage station. It was close to the road. That\u2019s where they had stopped. Said it was a big rock. I asked her, \u201cWas the rock part of the foundation of the building?\u201d She said, \u201cI think it was more foundation for the chimney.\u201d She said that rock had been turned over, and there was a neat, little vault about eight inches square and maybe eight inches deep. There it was, a neat little vault with nothing in it. She figured they\u2019d gotten gold or money out of it. That happened in the thirties. loh-162 Years ago, when the Perkins started over into this area from Mississippi, this family pooled all their money. They had it in a flour barrel. John Reed\u2019s great grandmother had it in her family and had a cloth over it. One of the kin folks\u2019 children come over there one cold morning and didn\u2019t have any shoes. She took him aside about where his shoes were and all, and he said, \u201cI just don\u2019t have any.\u201d She said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m gonna stop that.\u201d She went in to the pantry where this flour barrel was. John Reed\u2019s grandmother went with her. She was just a little girl then. She said her grandmother, John Reed\u2019s great grandmother, threw this cloth back and reached in there and got a piece of money and gave it to this little kid. Told him, \u201cNow you tell your mother to buy you some shoes.\u201d Well, while she was doin\u2019 this, John\u2019s grandmother, she couldn\u2019t see into the barrel, but she reached over it and she could feel this money. There was that much money in there in this flour barrel. They had pooled all their money and put it together. So later on, one of \u2018em, I don\u2019t know which one, was charged (given the responsibility) with taking this money and what was it? A couple of slaves. He headed west to buy land for the whole family. He was supposed to buy land. But he got down to where they call Big Woods, and he sickened and died. Now, the slaves told the story that this money is buried in there. By the time they made their way back to Mississippi, they couldn\u2019t remember where it was. They had buried all this money he had. What it was in then, I don\u2019t know. It was probably in boxes. Evidently, this money was supposed to be buried there. That money, as far as anybody knows, has never been discovered. But that whole area has been dug up! loh-162b Her (his wife, Maggie) father one time, when he was a boy, there used to be a store just west of here, Field\u2019s. It\u2019s still there. He was playing there on the porch, and he had a nugget. One of what they call a drummer, a salesman, come by and said, \u201cLet me see that, son.\u201d He looked at it and it was supposedly silver. He gave him fifty cents. Told him, \u201cI\u2019ll pay you more if you take me\u201d \u2013 now, there\u2019s a little creek out there, Windham Creek \u2013 \u201cIf you take me back and show me where you found this.\u201d He said he was just about eight or nine years old, playing along this creek. He was sure he could find it, so he took this fellow up there to show him where it was. He never could find the place where he found it. One time out east of town here, a guy found a stump full of money. A hollow tree. Come to find out, it was slot machines stolen from the old Pines nightclub. All these nickels and stuff was hidden in this stump, in this hollow tree. loh-163 One of the most famous stories here is after the War of 1812. Jean Lafitte, the pirate, was still active here. He helped the United States in the Battle of New Orleans when Jackson defeated the British. They let him go, and he went to Galveston. The city of Galveston was founded by Jean Lafitte. He moved, supposedly, all his operations and headquarters outside the jurisdiction of the United States. But his biggest market, of course, was New Orleans. He would ply his piracy and his trade there. At night, they knew all these swamps and innerland that the U.S. didn\u2019t know, the Coast Guard didn\u2019t know. And he would slip his stuff in through Barataria Bay and peddle it to New Orleans. One time one of his sloops or ships was apprehended, almost apprehended, by the U.S. Coast Guard. When they got to what they thought was waters outside of the United States, they turned into Sabine Lake. But it wasn\u2019t at that time outside of the United States. The Coast Guard was so close behind them that they scuttled their ship and sank it. There\u2019s always been a claim that they buried whatever they had somewhere in that area. People still look for the money there. loh-164 Have you all heard anything about hunting money? Well, that\u2019s the thing I\u2019m gonna get involved with here. I went on a hunting expedition. And people don\u2019t know what actually goes on. I was invited to go on this trip, and they explained to me what it was. I\u2019d never heard of it before. That was news to me. Okay, people a long time ago (pause) they claimed they buried their money. That was back when they had the slaves and all that there. And they, this old slave owner, he\u2019d have a lot of money to bury. Well, he\u2019d take his most-trusted slave he had. His old slave. And he\u2019d take him with him. Well, he\u2019d go out and he\u2019d pick him out a spot where he wanted it. And he\u2019d tell the old slave, \u201cNow, I want you to dig right here.\u201d And he\u2019d put it about four or five foot deep. Well, the old slave\u2019d be down there digging. When he thought it was deep enough, the old slave owner\u2019d tell him, \u201cNow, look. I want you to promise me something. That you\u2019ll guard this money as long as you can.\u201d And the old slave\u2019d say, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll do that, boss.\u201d Well, then he would, he\u2019d shoot him. Kill him. Well, then the owner\u2019d cover the hole up. He was the only man that knew where it was. That slave down in there, the belief was, that the slave, his spirit, would continue to guard that money. Well, these people decided how to get around that. Well, I went off on this trip with \u2018em. I saw things I thought I\u2019d never see again. They told me when they went, they said, \u201cYou gotta be pure.\u201d Now, these are grown men. These ain\u2019t little boys. They said, \u201cYou can\u2019t have any dealings with your wife for a week, at least seven days before this hunt.\u201d Well, these guys hired a man from the other side of Houma to come over here. He was supposed to be a professional finder. Well, he done it for a fee. They had to pay him, his expenses, to come over here. He brought a guy with him, and the two of \u2018em drove from Houma over here. He had a forked rod. And that\u2019s the thing he used to hunt the money with there. They could find it. Well, we went way out in the country to an old plantation deal there. They told us, they said, \u201cNow, y\u2019all stay here. And if that money\u2019s within a mile of here, we can find it.\u201d And he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll come back and get y\u2019all.\u201d So he told \u2018em all that. Well, we sat there in the dark, and he told us, \u201cNow don\u2019t talk loud. Y\u2019all can just whisper.\u201d So it was weird. I mean I was sitting there, and I didn\u2019t know what was going on. Well, in a little while, they come back. And the guy said, \u201cWe\u2019ve located it.\u201d He said, \u201cNow, this is what I want y\u2019all to do. When we start out to get it, they can\u2019t nobody say another word.\u201d So, we trailed along behind \u2018em back through the woods. And it was dark. We was stumbling over roots and everything else. And we finally got to the point, the place there, and they had an old lantern. It was the only light we had, and they had it up in front. We was all in the back. And they got up there and sure enough, there was that forked piece of metal sticking in the ground where they\u2019d located it. Well, they told us, and everybody, wasn\u2019t nobody saying a word. They was motioning, stand back and all that there. Well, all at once, this guy come out with a little old box. This was the part that was weird to me. He got that box and he went in there and he had some white powder. I know it was flour. That\u2019s what it looked like. He went and made a big circle around the whole thing. That was to keep that spirit in there. In other words, to keep that spirit from getting that money and running with it. It was their belief that once you got that powder around it, he couldn\u2019t cross that powder. Well, they got there and they got that old powder\u2019d up. Then they started digging. And I mean they was going at it fast. Nobody wasn\u2019t saying a word, it was just strictly just everybody was working. I didn\u2019t know nothing about it. I did get in there and dig just a little bit, but I was [pause] more or less [pause] wanting to watch than anything else. Well, they dug a hole , I bet you, it was seven-foot deep. You could\u2019ve buried a car in it. There was some of them fellers there, they wouldn\u2019t work in a pie factory. But boy they was at it with that digging. Well, they was going at it and all at once, one of them fellers got a coughing spell. Well when he did, this guy that was supposed to be the professional, he just got up and said, \u201cBoys, it\u2019s all over with.\u201d He said, \u201cIt\u2019s gone now.\u201d He said, \u201cI told you, you can\u2019t make no noise of no kind!\u201d He said, \u201cNow you can dig all day and they ain\u2019t no money there now.\u201d And that wound the money hunting up. Since then, I\u2019ve heard other people talk about going on trips, and they always blame it on something! Even one time, they got so mad with one of the guys, they thought he\u2019d lied [inaudible]. They thought he was lying. I never heard of nobody finding the money. But they\u2019re right close to it. Now, there\u2019s people right today that\u2019s still doing it. Here a while back, I heard a man down below his house there, he went to work one morning and there was a hole there the side of the field. He said he don\u2019t know when they dug that! It was some time during the night! loh-165 You know, some people believe in haints and some don\u2019t. Ghosts or whatever they call them. But it\u2019s something. Something that I couldn\u2019t explain now. I\u2019ve seen things, heard things. A lot of people don\u2019t believe it. But I have seen things happen on different occasions, living in the country. It\u2019s unexplainable. I don\u2019t know why or what it was, but I\u2019ve seen things that I just couldn\u2019t explain what it was. I was trying to remember the time that three fellows came up and asked me to go with them and show them where I had seen, what they said, the haints, spirits. I actually seen it, and they said wherever you see something like that, well usually treasure, money buried around. These three fellows came up and asked me would I show them where I seen this spirit or whatever it was. I\u2019m getting ahead. What I really seen, must\u2019ve been about nine, ten years old. About first dark one night, I was on my way home. First I heard something that sounded like singing, moaning a song or something. I stopped to see what it was, and then when I did see it, it looked almost like them clouds out there. But it wasn\u2019t as big as that cloud, it was just like a vapor like. But it was just floating through the air. I couldn\u2019t make out what it was, and when I realized it wasn\u2019t real, when it passed by the chicken house, the chickens started cuttin\u2019 up. And it came in front of me, and went out in the [inaudible] and just settled down. But it was still like it was singing. By that time, I done got up enough nerve in my feet to run. And I taken off to the house. Run in there and told my dad about it. And so he said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s just somebody out there trying to scare you.\u201d And he got up, got the shotgun, went outside. I told him, I went out to the porch and showed him where the last time I seen it was. So he went on out that aways. I come on back in the house, waiting to hear the gun to go off. Few minutes, still hadn\u2019t heard the gun go off, I heard him coming back running! He said when he got out there, when he raised that gun up to where I had told him that thing was, said something got all over him and that gun. Man, he come back in that house. Said something was out there. After that, these two men came along must\u2019ve been about twenty-five, thirty years later, wanting to know where did I see this at. And I told them. They asked me could they go back there. Well, the house had been torn down and all growed up out there now. So anyway, I\u2019m taking them out there, and these fellows had one of these treasure things, like you hunt buried treasure with. He had one of those, and one of them had some other kind of little gimmick. Another had a little Testament, a New Testament. I got to the place we was supposed to go. So this fellow with the little Bible, he went out and sat down on a log and started reading. Fellow with this treasure deal, he started moving it around on the ground. Finally this thing started making some kind of whining noise. Getting louder and louder. And so he said, \u201cSomething down here.\u201d We got a shovel and dug down in there. Kept in and dug a little more. Finally didn\u2019t did no more. We taking it out the hole, and that\u2019s where they found it. When we did find it, a fifty cents piece. Search and search, couldn\u2019t find nothing else. I said, \u201cWell, this ain\u2019t where I seen the haint at. It\u2019s over here between these two cedar trees. We went over there. He got in between them trees, and I said, \u201cIt\u2019s closer to the one on the right.\u201d And so he went over that way, and that thing started making this whining noise and going on. At this time, a great big, I say a blackbird. Looked like a blackbird to me, but it was real black. It looked like it was blue. But it had a real yellow beak, and two big orange eyes, and he lit up in that cedar tree and he starts making croaking noise like a crow. Then another one, then another one. The more we searched, the more them big old birds get in that tree. Finally, them birds, got so many got in that tree it look like it was just leaning backwards and forwards. This man told me, said, \u201cI tell you what, something has been here. But somebody done found it now.\u201d Said, \u201cWe better go!\u201d He packed up his junk, we left. But I honestly believe they went back out after I had helped them locate where I thought. I didn\u2019t know what was there, but I believe they located something and they went back after they got rid of me. Keep from dividing with me. If there was anything there, keep from dividing with me. It was near night, so they carried me back home, and I wasn\u2019t about to go back there by myself! But anyway, that\u2019s what happened that particular night. uls-001 A relative of ours lived in the country near the woods of Morse and Crowley when she was a little girl. She lived in an house that was stilts so that when a flood came their house would be okay. When she was a child, our relative would play with the other kids under the house during the summer to stay out of the heat. The story goes that our relative, along with the rest of the children, saw a man sitting on a wooden chest beneath the house. This apparition did nothing to the children, although it did frighten them for a time. Strangely, only our relative and the children could see it. Not the adults. uls-002 The same relative had a husband who went out into the wooded region in that area. Along with his brother, they went looking for cypress moss for cushioning their pillows and blankets. This was way back in the day. As they were searching, they noticed a stone slab on the ground beneath a tree. It was odd because the husband and his brother weren\u2019t able to move the slab of stone. It seemed to be stuck in the ground. Then, they got this weird feeling. Something wasn\u2019t quite right with the stone. The two men freaked out, and they climbed the tree in fear. When they looked down, the slab of stone disappeared. They jumped down from the tree and ran home. uls-003 Later that same day, after my grandmother had told me these stories, I heard almost the exact same story told by a friend of mine. This story seems to be a common legend in southern Louisiana. He said that two relatives of his went hunting out in the woods one night. When and where exactly, I don\u2019t know. They too saw the stone slab. Upon returning to the woods again to find it, it had disappeared. My friend said that the mysterious stone slab never stays in the same place. And if one sees it, you\u2019re supposed to dig in front of it to find buried treasure. My friend also mentioned how some people see a tombstone instead of stone slab. Some people also see a man standing next to or is sitting on the stone. uls-004 Upon hearing this, I couldn\u2019t help but think of pirates who buried their treasure in southern Louisiana. I learned in history this semester that pirates would bury their treasure on land and ask one of the crewmen to protect it. The one to protect the treasure was shot dead, so that his soul would guard the treasure forever. Perhaps these two stories are connected in some way. uls-005 So, they had this old man, this is like the slave era in Louisiana. Well, not necessarily slave but, you had this era where they had kind of like Jim Crow laws, you know? They weren\u2019t born slaves anymore, but they still worked in a kind of indentured servitude, in a kind of fashion. And, he had, this old man he had a couple of \u201cslaves\u201d, and what he would do, (he was very cruel, a cruel man, a cruel master. He\u2019s very superstitious though) so what he would do if a slave did something wrong, in order to guard his fortune, he would either bury them alive while holding his money, his money or something valuable, and even it would get morbid, like, they had old whiskey barrels, and he would put glass and nails on them and then roll them downhills. He was just cruel. Well, the day that he died they said that he spontaneously combusted and that, nothing else burnt. The only thing that was left of him was a giant suit mark on the bed, where he was. He died in his bed. uls-006 Me and my brothers would hear this story a lot from one of our neighbor\u2019s parents, she said she was a fortune teller. Supposedly, there was treasure buried by a stump and only a child could find it. The treasure would rise up out of the ground and appear to the children. The only time a child could find it is if they were playing by the stump, but if they left to go get help to get the treasure, when they came back for it, it was gone. It had disappeared. It didn\u2019t pay for a grown up to go look for it because they wouldn\u2019t find it. uls-007 I had a cousin, he\u2019s dead now, he served during Vietnam as a navy seal, and when he came back\u00ad. In the same woods, there\u2019s like a legend saying that (it\u2019s an old Indian legend) that if you find this kind of like plate\u2026 it looks kind of like, some sort of like Indian, like native american\u2026writing, or just mosaics like that, so, if you find this plate, according to the legend, where that plate sits, right underneath is a great treasure. Well, my cousin Glen was in the woods one day, he might have been hunting or something, he finds this kind of plate, and he remembered that legend, so what he did was he tried to make a trail on the way back, like scratching trees, like carving certain stuff in trees, to make sure that he could make his way back, he didn\u2019t have shovels or anything. So he comes back, I think with someone else, maybe a friend, to come and dig it up, and where the plate was, was gone, and according to another little part of that legend, the reason why it shows up is the spirits are trying to kind of play a trick on you, to get you lost in the woods, \u2018cause he\u2019s like \u201coh, yeah, I wanna come back and\u201d \u2026 he was just smart and scratching his way, like marking his way back. uls-008 The legend goes the person- it was like a umm, a farm that people had lived on that farm And the white people killed somebody and buried some money under them to say to protect their money And during that time That\u2019s how- I guess- that\u2019s how things had work at the time But we found out And we went try to get it And we could never get it because something was always running around You could dig but the change -You could hear the change falling deeper and deeper and deeper The more you dig The deeper it get So we never had a chance to get to it. And I guess no one will get to it. uls-009 The thing is- Like he said, like Gator said The thing is back then A man asked a worker -must\u2019ve been a worker If he would\u2019ve watch his money And the worker- one of the workers said \u201cno\u201d And he asked this other worker if he wanted to watch his money The worker said \u201cyea\u201d he would\u2019ve watch his money So what they did- They kill him Bury him underground And the money And now you watching it So the one that say he was watching the money They kill him And they buried him Now he watching the money He said he was gonna watch it Yep. uls-010 That\u2019s it over there. They use to have a house in there. Right there where the trees is they use to have a house in there. Probably got the mark where the house is now. We used to go in there. We couldn\u2019t go \u2026 we use to \u2026 we use to travel. We use to hear they had gold there. We\u2019ll go try to dig it, couldn\u2019t dig, couldn\u2019t dig. Me, Dexter, Kenneth, your daddy. Just about all of us, I think Roland too. We all tried. Couldn\u2019t, you couldn\u2019t even get the shovel in the ground. It\u2019s a certain time you could\u2019ve get it in. But you wasn\u2019t finding nothing. And you would hear noise in there. You hear \u2026 you hear strange noise. There in the trees. Yeah they had some stuff in there. A spirit. uls-011 Nah I ain\u2019t scared to go over there. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s none to be scared of. But, but it\u2019s still strange to hear. I think them old people say that spirit will not let you dig to get to the gold, whatever\u2019s down there. That\u2019s what them old people used to say. Its not going let ya \u2026 and it\u2019s kinda strange they clean all that. They clean all the distance, but they never clean that spot there.","title":"Louisiana Legends about Treasure #"},{"location":"531/legends/#louisiana-legends-about-treasure","text":"","title":"Louisiana Legends about Treasure"},{"location":"531/legends/#introduction","text":"For those not interested in reading all 27 text files on GitHub, I have made a single document out of them. You will note that each text is one big blob of text. That\u2019s my doing. When I first set up this collection, I deleted all the line returns because I had not yet mastered how to remove them when I was working with them in code. I now know how to do that, and I am in the process of adding back the line breaks, which were, by and large, by clause. So, the second text would look like this: I went to meet an old man in Marrero, and he told me a story. He went to look for a treasure with some other men. And there was a controller who had brought a Bible to control the spirits. And when they arrived at the site, they saw a big horse coming through the woods with a man riding it, and when he dismounted, it was no longer a man on the horse. It was a dog. And he said the dog came and rubbed itself against his legs. He said it was growling. He said he knew the dog was touching him, but he didn\u2019t feel anything. It was like there was just a wind. And he said they all took off running. He lost his hat and his glasses and he tore all his clothes. And even the controller ran off and he never saw his Bible again after that. To assemble all the texts into a single file, I used a command line utility called tail which displays the contents of a file with regard to line numbers. In the case of the command below, I told it to start with the first line, a rather long tail: tail -n +1 *.txt > ../all.txt I tell it to take all the text files, *.txt in the current directory and write the output to a new file, all.txt in the next level up directory \u2013 in this case it was my desktop. The advantage of using tail over cat \u2013 a utility which con cat enates files \u2013 is that tail automatically separates the compiled files with the name of the file from which the content was drawn. In the case of the file above, that looked like this: ==> anc-089.txt <== Because I wanted things to look nicer for you, I decided to convert the file names into markdown-style headers so that I could use markdown to convert the files to HTML. To do that, I first chopped off the part of the file name I didn\u2019t need plus the right-hand side of the division marker: .txt <== and replaced it with ## , which is the other side of the Heading 2 markup in markdown, but it could just as well have been nothing. Having done that, I replaced the lefthand part of the divider, ==> with the beginning of the markdown indicator for a second level heading, ## . Again, a Replace All in a text editor and we are done. Then we run the completed document through a markdown implementation, converting it to HTML, and apply a cascading style sheet we already have lying around and presto!

And as soon as they had dug a ways, there was a great big bull that came through the woods with flames coming out of his nose. So it passed. And it just touched the shovel of the man who was digging, and all of them got away. So as soon as the man looked, all the others were gone. So he left, too.

The hole was there, and the chest, and the markings of dollars were on the wood that they have broken off of the chest. So they had found it. The spirit controller had done it. It must be that he controlled the bull, the fire-breathing bull. But they said the flame was coming out of its nose and they could hear it coming through the woods.

He\u2019s got a very interesting story he can tell you.\u201d I said, \u201cI want to talk to him, by all means.\u201d So I went to see him, and he is a man by the name of Smith. They own the Piggly Wiggly store in Leesville. There\u2019s two of the brothers. I don\u2019t know if it was John, who is a state representative, John Smith, or if it was his brother. One of them told me about it. One of them told me to go see their dad. So Mr. Smith told me, he said that his grandfather, a man by the name of Brock, originally lived in Marthaville, Louisiana, in Natchitoches Parish. He had moved to the Rio Grande valley and was a farmer. This was along about 1912. There was a bandit by the name of Pancho Villa. He would come across the river and raid farms in Texas. Finally, well, for years they were trying to get the federal government to do something about it. They were pretty slow to react to it. He finally went up to Columbus, New Mexico. Killed a lot of people up there and done a lot of damage. They sent General Pershing. Later on, he was a famous World War I general over in Europe. He never did catch Pancho Villa, but he got close enough for Pancho Villa to decide he better stay out of the United States. Run him back across the river. But back to my story, he raided a farm next to Mr. Brock\u2019s. I suppose he probably killed some people, took what valuables they had, gold or stock. Scared Mr. Brock up pretty bad, and he decided he\u2019d just leave. Get out of there if that\u2019s the way it was gonna be. So he was packing up to come back to Marthaville, and there was an old Mexican on his place. Come to him and says, \u201cMr. Brock, I\u2019m gonna give you a map where you can dig up some money when you get back to Louisiana.\u201d Well, I stopped Mr. Smith right there and I said, \u201cNow, look, why didn\u2019t the Mexican go dig it up?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, he was an alien. He was not an American citizen. In those days, a law officer would just shoot one down.\u201d Mr. Brock came on back. In the spring of the year, he was making a crop. He had two grown boys to help him. They were after the old man, \u201cLet\u2019s go dig up the money. Let\u2019s go dig up the money.\u201d He was afraid they wouldn\u2019t get the crop in. But after the crop was laid by in the summertime, he said, \u201cAlright boys, we\u2019ll go see about it.\u201d So they went straight and dug up. There was a little cave. They dug the money up. It was twenty thousand dollars in silver. No gold. Mr. Smith told me, \u201cI took my grandfather back there several times. He wanted to go see where this money was dug up, so I took him there several times.\u201d I asked him, \u201cWell, would you take me and show me where it was?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll try. It\u2019s been a long time.\u201d Understand that they have straightened that road out. It used to have terrible curves. So we got over there. We went up there. It got pretty close to the place, and he said, \u201cIt\u2019s somewhere.

But they didn\u2019t find any more. There was an outlaw by the name of West. I believe, the best I remember, he might have rode with Murrell. He might have been in Murrell\u2019s gang when he was young. I think he was a Civil War veteran. I think he fought in the war. But he built him up a good little gang. But they were terrible as far as being heartless. Throw people in wells! Just let \u2018em starve to death! Killing babies, all kinds of stuff.

It was their belief that once you got that powder around it, he couldn\u2019t cross that powder. Well, they got there and they got that old powder\u2019d up. Then they started digging. And I mean they was going at it fast. Nobody wasn\u2019t saying a word, it was just strictly just everybody was working. I didn\u2019t know nothing about it. I did get in there and dig just a little bit, but I was [pause] more or less [pause] wanting to watch than anything else. Well, they dug a hole , I bet you, it was seven-foot deep. You could\u2019ve buried a car in it. There was some of them fellers there, they wouldn\u2019t work in a pie factory. But boy they was at it with that digging. Well, they was going at it and all at once, one of them fellers got a coughing spell. Well when he did, this guy that was supposed to be the professional, he just got up and said, \u201cBoys, it\u2019s all over with.\u201d He said, \u201cIt\u2019s gone now.\u201d He said, \u201cI told you, you can\u2019t make no noise of no kind!\u201d He said, \u201cNow you can dig all day and they ain\u2019t no money there now.\u201d And that wound the money hunting up. Since then, I\u2019ve heard other people talk about going on trips, and they always blame it on something! Even one time, they got so mad with one of the guys, they thought he\u2019d lied [inaudible]. They thought he was lying. I never heard of nobody finding the money. But they\u2019re right close to it. Now, there\u2019s people right today that\u2019s still doing it. Here a while back, I heard a man down below his house there, he went to work one morning and there was a hole there the side of the field. He said he don\u2019t know when they dug that!

But it\u2019s something. Something that I couldn\u2019t explain now. I\u2019ve seen things, heard things. A lot of people don\u2019t believe it. But I have seen things happen on different occasions, living in the country. It\u2019s unexplainable. I don\u2019t know why or what it was, but I\u2019ve seen things that I just couldn\u2019t explain what it was. I was trying to remember the time that three fellows came up and asked me to go with them and show them where I had seen, what they said, the haints, spirits. I actually seen it, and they said wherever you see something like that, well usually treasure, money buried around. These three fellows came up and asked me would I show them where I seen this spirit or whatever it was. I\u2019m getting ahead. What I really seen, must\u2019ve been about nine, ten years old. About first dark one night, I was on my way home. First I heard something that sounded like singing, moaning a song or something. I stopped to see what it was, and then when I did see it, it looked almost like them clouds out there. But it wasn\u2019t as big as that cloud, it was just like a vapor like. But it was just floating through the air. I couldn\u2019t make out what it was, and when I realized it wasn\u2019t real, when it passed by the chicken house, the chickens started cuttin\u2019 up. And it came in front of me, and went out in the [inaudible] and just settled down. But it was still like it was singing. By that time, I done got up enough nerve in my feet to run. And I taken off to the house. Run in there and told my dad about it. And so he said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s just somebody out there trying to scare you.\u201d And he got up, got the shotgun, went outside. I told him, I went out to the porch and showed him where the last time I seen it was. So he went on out that aways. I come on back in the house, waiting to hear the gun to go off. Few minutes, still hadn\u2019t heard the gun go off, I heard him coming back running! He said when he got out there, when he raised that gun up to where I had told him that thing was, said something got all over him and that gun. Man, he come back in that house. Said something was out there. After that, these two men came along must\u2019ve been about twenty-five, thirty years later, wanting to know where did I see this at. And I told them. They asked me could they go back there. Well, the house had been torn down and all growed up out there now. So anyway, I\u2019m taking them out there, and these fellows had one of these treasure things, like you hunt buried treasure with. He had one of those, and one of them had some other kind of little gimmick. Another had a little Testament, a New Testament. I got to the place we was supposed to go. So this fellow with the little Bible, he went out and sat down on a log and started reading. Fellow with this treasure deal, he started moving it around on the ground. Finally this thing started making some kind of whining noise. Getting louder and louder. And so he said, \u201cSomething down here.\u201d We got a shovel and dug down in there. Kept in and dug a little more. Finally didn\u2019t did no more. We taking it out the hole, and that\u2019s where they found it. When we did find it, a fifty cents piece. Search and search, couldn\u2019t find nothing else. I said, \u201cWell, this ain\u2019t where I seen the haint at. It\u2019s over here between these two cedar trees. We went over there. He got in between them trees, and I said, \u201cIt\u2019s closer to the one on the right.\u201d And so he went over that way, and that thing started making this whining noise and going on. At this time, a great big, I say a blackbird. Looked like a blackbird to me, but it was real black. It looked like it was blue. But it had a real yellow beak, and two big orange eyes, and he lit up in that cedar tree and he starts making croaking noise like a crow. Then another one, then another one. The more we searched, the more them big old birds get in that tree. Finally, them birds, got so many got in that tree it look like it was just leaning backwards and forwards. This man told me, said, \u201cI tell you what, something has been here. But somebody done found it now.\u201d Said, \u201cWe better go!\u201d He packed up his junk, we left. But I honestly believe they went back out after I had helped them locate where I thought. I didn\u2019t know what was there, but I believe they located something and they went back after they got rid of me. Keep from dividing with me. If there was anything there, keep from dividing with me. It was near night, so they carried me back home, and I wasn\u2019t about to go back there by myself!

John Laudun HLG 356, Tuesdays 9-12 and by appointment laudun@louisiana.edu COURSE DESCRIPTION This course is a survey of key concepts, problems, and perspectives in folklore theory and method, focusing on key moments, ideas, and texts in the evolution of folklore studies in order to acquire a \u201cfeel\u201d for the foundations of the discipline. For the purposes of this course, the field is conceived fairly broadly and includes work done in adjacent fields like anthropology, sociology, psychology, linguistics, and literary studies. As much as it is possible, the readings are chronological, allowing us to follow the interactive dimensions of intellectual history, wherein one theory arises as a response to (extension of, corrective of, or refutation of) another theory. Mileage in such a chronology must vary, however, as some texts (usually those that awaited translation) are considered in the context of those texts they most influenced. The purpose of any proseminar is to acquaint students with the core texts or theories of a particular field of inquiry. Folklore\u2019s diverse beginnings and many interrelations make it particularly difficult to gather all such materials into a semester of study. The aim of this course, then, is to familiarize you with those texts, thinkers, and ideas that seem central in light of recent developments in the discipline and to acquaint you with other texts, thinkers, and ideas so that you may begin to see these complex webs for yourself. A proseminar assumes you have an interest in a field or discipline as a profession, not necessarily as a professional practicing within the field, but as someone interested in the history and nature of the practices of the field as it has developed over time and through various institutions. We will, then, spend the semester reading from folklore\u2019s intellectual history and discussing the implications (those) ideas have for our understanding and uses of folklore. Speaking of the field, we will not in this course address directly, in the sense of how-to, the topic of fieldwork, though we will on a regular occasion be concerned with methodology as it is implicated in various theories. That does not lessen the importance of fieldwork, and I encourage, but do not require, all those trying to understand the discipline of folklore studies to do some kind of fieldwork. Extended fieldwork, in the sense of lasting beyond the first interview, is an experience that no one with an investment in the discipline should be without. A more extensive treatment of fieldwork theories and methods is to be found in the folklore fieldwork course. Finally, there are some methods and skills which any competent \u201cknowledge worker\u201d \u2014 more on the use of this term during the semester \u2014 should have in this day and age. Some of them have long been within the purview of folklore studies Specifically, folklorists have always, in some ways, engaged the collection and sorting of data that today\u2019s databases make, in many ways, trivial. We will talk about this and other matters throughout the semester, but you should also feel free to bring such topics and concerns up as part of our ongoing conversation. The goal of this course is to familiarize you with an intellectual history, and in some ways landscape, of a particular discipline, folklore studies, in order for you to begin to map out where your own interests lie. I hope that the materials we cover, and their attendant bibliographies and references, will begin to suggest possibilities for you, but there are always more books and journals than can be scribbled down here. Your real job is to go out and find that territory which interests you. COURSE REQUIREMENTS In addition to the obvious requirement that everyone come to class with the reading done, with at least two to three questions or comments prepared, and the willingness to engage in a discussion, seminar participants are, this semester, required to write a literature review on a topic, or topics, of her choosing as well as leading a seminar or sequence of seminars on a topic. (All such topics are to be established in dialogue with the instructor.) Participation A full quarter of your grade is based on that ever-slippery notion of \u201cparticipation.\u201d I leave it up to you to concretize it in a way that manifests the sublimity of your wit, the substance of your thought, and the grace of your presence. Nota bene: I take participation very seriously in all my classes, but most especially in seminars. (45%) Presentation(s) This is a seminar. Everyone is responsible for its success, not just the instructor. As a seminar participant, each of you will be responsible for leading the class at various moments throughout the semester. Each presentation will be based on a different infrastructure: an abstract, an outline, a series of slides with text, a series of slides with only graphics, etc. (15%) In the past, I have encouraged or required participants to profile a journal or to review a book. The description of those assignments is included here for your information: it should be noted that writing a book review is an easy way to get published, and it was once seen as part of the overall functioning of a scholarly domain. Journal Profile In parallel with books, the record of any discipline is to be found in its journals. They are also the places where young scholars have their best opportunity to see their ideas in print. I encourage all graduate students to join their respective disciplinary organizations, especially while student rates apply, but I also require that participants in this seminar acquaint themselves with the journals available to them as resources and outlets for their work. Book Review You will write one book review, following the JAF format, on a text of your choosing. Please see me if you are having any difficulty in deciding upon a book. (Book reviews are also a great way to get published.) Both the reviews and the profiles above will be compiled into a seminar publication. Literature Review Because of the nature of this course, I forego the most familiar of all course assignment genres, the seminar paper, and instead ask you to imagine a project, of a size and scope to be decided, and to sketch out what resources you will need.

These two logics, rationalism and nationalism, so govern our thinking that we cannot, at times, comprehend the complexities of history \u2014 i.e., that history itself is a cynical arrangement of dynasties perfecting the technologies of domination that reached its nadir in the brutality of the colonial era, an era in which we still abide.

Throughout this history, we will retain texts as our primary object for understanding human nature. The questions we need to remind ourselves to ask are: What is history\u2019s relationship to our object of study throughout these transformations? What new questions have arisen? What do texts do? Why texts? It\u2019s important to remember that these changes within the narrow domain of how we imagine human discursive productivity are really part of a larger collection of histories, some intellectual and some political. Nineteenth century interest in folklore was, to some degree, spurred by concerns over (1) industrialization and the social changes being wrought by it and (2) the political and cultural domination of one nation by another: of Germany by France; Ireland by Britain; Finland by Russia. One German intellectual in particular, J.G. Herder, urged German poets and composers to turn to the traditions of the peasants, whose traditional tales and songs preserved the authentic national spirit, identity, values of the German people. These were, Herder argued, the proper basis, the raw materials, for elite literature and music. The Brothers Grimm were among those whom Herder inspired. But the Grimms were not interested in the tellers, or the role tale-telling played among the peasants who perpetuated the tradition. They looked upon the tales they collected as declined myth, and were interested only in the texts and what they thought it told them about earlier, purer, forms of German culture. Others began collecting folklore in other countries for similar reasons. In this vein, William Thoms coined the term \u201cfolk-lore\u201d in 1846. Thoms interest was \u201cpopular antiquities\u201d\u201d but he preferred a \u201cgood Anglo-Saxon word\u201d\u201d for it. Like the Grimms, Thoms regarded folklore as a survival from an earlier time, a vestige of an earlier stage of development in human society and culture, with no function or relevance today, and no contemporary meaning. The Grimms, and most of those they inspired, virtually ignored the actual \u201clife\u201d of the lore. Fieldwork standards at that time were very loose \u2014 merely collecting, not ethnography; there was no idea of adhering to the spoken language of tale-tellers, of valuing the stories as actually told, of trying to observe actual storytelling events. Rather, the standard practice was to rewrite texts \u2014 to \u201cimprove\u201d them for a literate readership. For those less familiar with European history in general and European intellectual history in particular, Christof Koch\u2019s review of George Makari\u2019s Soul Machine: The Invention of the Modern Mind is a thumbnail sketch of the developments in Western European philosophy that led up to our current moment of understanding human consciousness in the particular way we do: \u201cConstructing the Modern Mind\u201d .

Instructor : John Laudun, HLG 356, 482-5493, laudun@louisiana.edu. Office hours: Mondays and Wednesdays, 9-11AM and by appointment. Course Description In general, there is a cluster of issues that concern humanists: all of them revolve around the production of cultural expressive forms and the relationship between individual expression and the communities in which these forms emerge. The digital humanities represent the merging of two areas of activity that have run for a long time as distinct concerns: humanities computing and the use and study of digital media \u2014 sometimes known as new media. The digital humanities have the potential both to develop new kinds of analyses and publications as well as to re-invigorate present practices, and even to renew practices (e.g., indices) that have become disused in our current era. This course surveys issues and activities in order to acquaint students with the overall landscape of the digital humanities. We will, over the course of the semester examine textual markup and its uses, databases and their uses, approaches to visualization and distant reading, network theory, and corpus methodologies. The course requires no prior knowledge of the digital humanities, but it does assume familiarity with computers and their standard uses (word processing, web browsing, etc.). Participants engage in a number of exploratory activities and small projects, which are intended to make it possible for them to choose a larger project on which to work which suits their own interests and expertise as well as the requirements suggested by the research itself \u2014 which is something that the digital humanities can offer: matching the publication \u2014 text, photo gallery, audio or video netcast \u2014 to the topic being considered. Course Texts and Other Accessories The texts I plan(ned) to use for this seminar are below, but only buy the first one. The Schriebman et al. text is expensive, and I am trying to determine if there is an alternative. Required Moretti, Franco. 2007. Maps, Graphs, and Trees . Verso. (ISBN: 1844671852) Schriebman, Siemens, Unsworth (ed). 2008. A Companion to Digital Humanities . Wiley-Blackwell. (ISBN: 1405168064). (An on-line version of the text is available .) Recommended Eric Raymond\u2019s The Cathedral and the Bazaar was, and is, an essential description, and somewhat of a manifesto, for open source software and thus of open, or community, source materials in general. The link is to the postscript of the document, which gives you the entire book in one link, but there is are other versions available. Why open source might be interesting to a humanist might be more clearly articulated by Lawrence Lessig in Free Culture . Lessig is a professor of law at Stanford University and a long-time advocate for a creative commons. (The book is also available in paperback in almost any bookstore as well as in an on-line HTML version.) We will be reading a lot of e-texts. Participants must decide for themselves how they want to interact with those documents \u2013 remember either to figure printing costs into the costs of the course and/or the time required to print for free on campus in the various venues. (Be aware of any printing restrictions.) We will also be using two web applications/services, Wordpress.com and Dropbox.com , both of which offer better experiences with some kind of broadband connection. A lot of the software we will be using in the course of the seminar is open source. That does not necessarily mean that it runs on any platform. In the lab we have the advantage of machines that can boot both into Mac OS X, which is a Unix, as well as Windows. If participants wish to use the software elsewhere, they will need to calculate the cost, either monetarily or in terms of time (and perhaps both), to set up their own systems. In addition to these potential costs, there is also the matter of portable storage. Media production, especially video, can take up quite a bit of storage space. (One hour of compressed video takes up about 5GB.) Participants interested in working with large resolution image, audio, or video files will want to invest either in a very large flash drive or in a modest external hard drive. The Macintosh Pros in the lab support both USB and Firewire 800 devices. Assignments and Grading This is an exploratory course in the digital humanities and for the digital humanities at the university. As such it depends greatly upon your participation , which includes your willingness to try a wide variety of things out, some (or even many) of which may not appear to you either at first glance or ever to have a meaningful outcome. To some degree this uncertainty in meaning is a function of how new the \u201cfield\u201d of digital humanities is not only to you but also in the academy. For example, I will require all of us, including me, to free write for five minutes at the beginning of every seminar. I do so not only because I think free writing is an important life skill, one useful far beyond the immediate impact it may have on making you a productive scholar, but also because we will, later in the course, need some data with which to work. If nothing else, you will have a data set consisting of your free writing. So that\u2019s at least two activities upon which you will be graded. In addition to these activities, I will ask you to write a pre- and a post-seminar essay in which you describe what you know and what you wish to know, as well as later what you learned, about the digital humanities. Again, some of you will recognize this as the KWL activity, and I offer it as something useful not only in your own work, both in your scholarship and in your teaching, but also something useful no matter what career your pursue. The larger assignment you have in this course is an essay/project in which you try out some of the ideas and methods we explore in the course of the seminar to a topic or a body of content with which you are familiar. The essay should document the methodology you used, the results you acquired, and how these results relate to results of more traditional forms of scholarship. (Remember, scholarship itself has undergone radical changes in the last fifty years, and so we should never imagine in the course of this seminar that we are working from a static base.)

Allow 4 hours total for writing the three essays, leaving the remaining hour to plan, review, revise, and proofread. Directions: In response to three of the questions or propositions below (select one from each of the three groups below), write well-developed essays that articulate and develop a thesis or argument. If the question asks for an explanation or description, be sure to present a focused, well-developed response. Group One: Disciplinary and Theoretical Concerns Like a number of disciplines within the academy, it is not uncommon to find in folklore studies that a few key terms are central to any particular moment in its discourse (e.g. \u201cperformance\u201d). Choose from among any of the terms that you believe to have possessed such centrality or to possess it currently and argue for why it has, or had, that status. Alternatively, choose a term either from folklore studies\u2019 past or from another discipline and argue why that term should become central (again). For a considerable portion of its history, folklore studies was transfixed by the folktale. In what way did that focus shape the discipline? What insights did it lead to and what blindnesses has it bequeathed us? Group Two: Texts and Contexts In a recent work on folklore and fiction, Frank DeCaro and Rosan Jordan situate the distinction between folklore and literature as: \u201cwritten language vs. oral (and even non-verbal) . . fixed, printed text vs. a shifting, unwritten one; a physical text vs. memory.\u201d The central premise of DeCaro and Jordan\u2019s claim, that there exists a fundamental tension between orality and literacy, has a long history in our discipline (e.g. ) In this essay, look at three works of literature that interrogate and even trouble this binary in form and/or in content. Folklore studies presents the opportunity to uncover overlooked dimensions of literary texts (for example, folk belief, foodways, and folk costuming). For this answer, perform a close reading of several literary texts that focuses on one such dimension. Group Three: Arenas for Application You\u2019ve been invited to lecture at another university on the topic of Folk Heroes. What would you discuss and why? Establish parameters for a lesson plan or outreach program to be used in a local community that integrates living history or folk culture.

Secondary: Candidates electing to take their major exam in Africana Studies will submit a portfolio that includes the following components: an intergenre bibliography of primary sources (75 texts), a bibliography of secondary sources (25 texts),an annotated bibliography (15 texts), a literature review (10 texts, 4000 words), two questions and answers (4000-4500 words), an oral defense. The intergenre bibliography of primary sources will demonstrate a sense of breadth and scope of the Africana literary canon, from its beginnings to present. This bibliography can focus exclusively on the African American canon, or the canon can include Anglophone literature from other locations in the Diaspora. The bibliography of secondary sources will target a topic of the candidate\u2019s choosing, comprised of theory, literary and/or cultural criticism, and literary and/or cultural histories. This bibliography may include texts in translation. The annotated bibliography will draw fifteen (15) texts from the bibliography of secondary sources. Annotation entry length: 150-250 words. The literature review will draw ten (10) texts from the annotated bibliography in order to synthesize patterns and convergences that shed light on the scholarly discourse about the candidate\u2019s chosen topic.

An oral examination focused on the above three components meant 1) to prepare the candidate to write the prospectus and 2) to allow the candidate to expand on the breadth and depth of their understanding of the period as demonstrated in the written portion of their portfolio. BL1: English Literature to c.1500 Major Exam Format: Timed on-site Area 1 for major examinations will be a timed, on-site examination of two separate sittings. Students will take the current three-part exam with any examinees minoring in Area 1.

The goal of this oral exam will be for the candidate to demonstrate broad reading knowledge of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century texts. This oral exam will be given by the three members of the student\u2019s major exam committee and does not replace the comprehensive oral exam given after the student has passed the major and three minor exams. The portfolio and oral components of the Area 2 Major Exam will be graded as a whole, and the student will receive the results by the announcement date for all other exams given that semester.

This can be based on a seminar paper, but should be more thoroughly researched and should include a cover letter that includes a conference proposal and the title of a conference to which the paper can be proposed. 20-25 page thoroughly researched article [on a different topic and texts from the conference paper]. This can and probably should be a seminar paper that has been reworked. However, it must have developed quite substantially beyond what was presented in the seminar. This article should be finished enough to be close to submission to a journal, and should include a cover letter [to the examiners] that states the argument and purpose of the article, along with the title of a journal to which it can be submitted. 2-3 page course proposal for a 200-level course for non-majors following our in-house 200-level course proposal guidelines. It should include several genres, should include texts from across the breadth of the 19th century and should not overlap in any significant way with existing courses \u2013 that is, it should be an original course proposal. Once the final version of the portfolio has been submitted, the student will undergo a 1-hour oral exam based on a wide-ranging 19th-cenury British literature reading list [provided to the student by faculty in the area.] This oral does not replace the final exam oral that covers all exam areas. Some reference may be made to weaknesses/strengths in the portfolio during this exam, but the goal of the oral is for the student to display her knowledge of a range of texts from across the long 19th Century. Examiners will make grading decisions after both the portfolio and oral components are completed. This means that the student must complete both components and will be informed of the pass/fail/needs revision status of the exam as a whole, and receive written comments on the exam as a whole. The student will receive the result of the whole exam at the exam result announcement date for all exams that semester. Note: If the student does well in the oral but it is deemed that the portfolio needs additional work, then that revision can be accomplished during the same semester as the exam.

Please note that the Creative Writing portfolio does not include creative work, and essays should not address one\u2019s own creative work. A reading list of 50 texts compiled by student and approved by CW studies exam committee in their genre, at least one semester before, ideally two semesters before, the exam is due. Texts may be individual essays, stories, poems, or full-length collections/novels. This list should reflect students critical and creative interests and should be viewed as preparation for the dissertation. The list should be accompanied by 1-2 page explanation of student\u2019s topic/interest, including the questions and explorations they hope to engage with. Students should be wary of issues of overlap with other exam areas, and have a range of historical periods on their reading list and secondary as well as primary texts. Each entry in the annotated bibliography of 25 texts should be 200-300 words, no longer. Entries should give a general overview of text, should cite at least one specific detail/scene/quoted material from the text, and should explain why text is useful for an investigation into exam topic.

While the committee will not read full drafts of essays, the student is encouraged to submit their topic/thesis statement to their exam committee for review. The short essay should examine trends/forms/craft/pedagogy or some aspect of the practice or teaching of creative writing. Pedagogical papers may take on a range of issues in the creative writing classroom, and should be thought of as a paper you could submit to a pedagogical journal. Craft essays should be prescriptive of one element of craft, but also use texts from the student\u2019s list to illustrate examples of success in that particular craft element. The student is encouraged to submit their essay topic/thesis statement to their exam committee for review. DRA: Drama Primary Exam Format: Portfolio as described below. Secondary Exam Format: .

To do this, the faculty ask that you: Write a comprehensive essay of approximately 5000 words. The essay should be clear to articulate a larger understanding of the domain of folklore studies as well as the writer\u2019s place within it. Paths through periods are perfectly acceptable, with a focus on predecessors encouraged. Compile a bibliography of no less than 50 items, divided into sections of your own devising with each section possessing a head note of 250 words or more. The bibliography should be wider in scope, and perhaps deeper in places, than those sources cited in the essay and could very well include work not yet read or not yet fully digested. Enumerate a series of research questions that identify both future research opportunities and gaps in the domain that you argue should be addressed, either by yourself or others.

The literature review will draw on the annotated bibliography in order to synthesize patterns and convergences that shed light on the scholarly discourse about the candidate\u2019s chosen topic. Review length: 8-10 pages. The journal article will take as its foundation these two components. The journal article should be approximately 7500 words in length (including notes).

Essays need to be worthy of \u201cB\u201d grade or higher in a seminar in order to pass the exam. Please note that the Creative Writing portfolio does not include creative work, and essays should not address one\u2019s own creative work. A reading list of 50 texts compiled by student and approved by CW studies exam committee in their genre, at least one semester before, ideally two semesters before, the exam is due. Texts may be individual essays, stories, poems, or full-length collections/novels. This list should reflect students critical and creative interests and should be viewed as preparation for the dissertation. The list should be accompanied by 1-2 page explanation of student\u2019s topic/interest, including the questions and explorations they hope to engage with. Students should be wary of issues of overlap with other exam areas, and have a range of historical periods on their reading list and secondary as well as primary texts.

Entries should give a general overview of text, should cite at least one specific detail/scene/quoted material from the text, and should explain why text is useful for an investigation into exam topic. Examples of entries are on Moodle. The student is encouraged to submit a draft of one entry to their exam committee for review. The long critical and scholarly essay (18-25 pages) is not on pedagogy or craft, but on any other topic specified within the declared genre and topic of the exam list, and making an original argument using texts from the list.

Some of that is about how we organize ourselves, see Dynamics below, and some of that is simply guidance on reading, writing, and working that I have collected over the years and have found both useful and compelling to students. Course Dynamics First, all students should read Rob Jenkins\u2019 essay on \u201cDefining the Relationship.\u201d Jenkins is also a professor of English at a regional state university in the south. His approach is similar to mine. Discussion, completion of assignments, and participation in course activities are an important part of how I structure a course. I prefer not to lecture from any given book so that I can add to our discussion and not repeat material found elsewhere \u2013 if repetition is important to you, then this may not be the course for you. Class meetings should be viewed in the same light as professionals view meetings in general: everyone arrives on time, if not early, and everyone takes notes no matter who is talking. (It goes without saying that you deserve everyone else\u2019s respect, and they deserve yours.) Note-taking is your responsibility, as is keeping up with what is happening or happened in class on a given day or what is due in class following your absence. (Not handing in an assignment because you didn\u2019t know about it because you missed class and did not contact one of your classmates still counts as not handing in the assignment.) Please write down the name and contact information of at least one other member of this class. The university maintains a strict absence policy. If an absence is at all foreseeable, especially if it falls on a due date, you should let me know as much in advance as you can in order to find a solution. The same goes for arriving late or departing early. If you are more than five minutes late, you will not be admitted to class \u2013 unless you have a very good narrative and can perform it with a zeal glimpsed only in performances by Cirque du Soleil or Frank Sinatra. Turn off all sources of distraction before coming into class. Cell phones must be set to silent and put away, unless you are expecting an emergency telephone call, in which case you should talk to me before class starts and sit near an exit so that you can excuse yourself and step outside to take the telephone call. Let me state this again: no cell phones . Simon Sinek has a good account of how cell phones satisfy us and, at the same time, keep us from the kinds of actions that lead to long-term things like relationships and satisfaction. All of you have a copy of the Code of Student Ethics. If you do not, please get one.

His approach is similar to mine. Discussion, completion of assignments, and participation in course activities are an important part of how I structure a course. I prefer not to lecture from any given book so that I can add to our discussion and not repeat material found elsewhere \u2013 if repetition is important to you, then this may not be the course for you. Class meetings should be viewed in the same light as professionals view meetings in general: everyone arrives on time, if not early, and everyone takes notes no matter who is talking. (It goes without saying that you deserve everyone else\u2019s respect, and they deserve yours.) Note-taking is your responsibility, as is keeping up with what is happening or happened in class on a given day or what is due in class following your absence. (Not handing in an assignment because you didn\u2019t know about it because you missed class and did not contact one of your classmates still counts as not handing in the assignment.) Please write down the name and contact information of at least one other member of this class. The university maintains a strict absence policy. If an absence is at all foreseeable, especially if it falls on a due date, you should let me know as much in advance as you can in order to find a solution. The same goes for arriving late or departing early. If you are more than five minutes late, you will not be admitted to class \u2013 unless you have a very good narrative and can perform it with a zeal glimpsed only in performances by Cirque du Soleil or Frank Sinatra. Turn off all sources of distraction before coming into class. Cell phones must be set to silent and put away, unless you are expecting an emergency telephone call, in which case you should talk to me before class starts and sit near an exit so that you can excuse yourself and step outside to take the telephone call. Let me state this again: no cell phones . Simon Sinek has a good account of how cell phones satisfy us and, at the same time, keep us from the kinds of actions that lead to long-term things like relationships and satisfaction. All of you have a copy of the Code of Student Ethics. If you do not, please get one.

For most, this is typically family and friends, but it could be mean, for some, having to interview individuals you know less well. Please be sensible in doing this.

If in doubt about what to do or how to handle material not your own in your work, please see me. Helping you to figure that stuff out is part of my job.

It assumes the interviewer has at least a notepad in hand and, perhaps, basic recording technology. An interview is not a dialogue. The whole point of the interview is to get the narrator to tell her story. Limit your own remarks to a few pleasantries to break the ice, then brief questions to guide her along. It is not necessary to give her the details of your great-grandmother\u2019s life growing up in Abbeville in order to get her to tell you about her grandfather\u2019s trip to Texas. Just say, \u201cI understand your grandfather went to Texas during the oil boom. What did he tell you about his time there?\u201d Ask questions that require more of an answer than \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d Start with \u201cwhy,\u201d \u201chow,\u201d \u201cwhere,\u201d \u201cwhat kind of \u2026\u201d instead of \u201cWas Henry Miller a good boss?\u201d ask \u201cWhat did the drilling crew say about Henry Miller?\u201d Ask one question at a time. Sometimes interviewers ask a series of questions all at once. Probably the narrator will answer only the first or last one. You will catch this kind of questioning when you listen through the recording after the session, and you can avoid it the next time. Ask brief questions. We all know the irrepressible speech-maker who, when questions are called for at the end of a lecture, gets up and asks five-minute questions. It is unlikely that the narrator is so dull that it takes more than a sentence or two for her to understand the question. Start with questions that are not controversial; save the delicate questions, if there are any, until you have become better acquainted. A good place to begin is with the narrator\u2019s youth and background. Don\u2019t let periods of silence fluster you. Give your narrator a chance to think of what she wants to add before you hustle her along with the next question. Relax, write a few words on your notepad. The sure sign of a beginning interviewer is a tape where every brief pause signals the next question Don\u2019t worry if your questions are not as beautifully phrased as you would like them to be for posterity. A few fumbled questions will help put your narrator at ease as she realizes that you are not perfect and she need not worry if she isn\u2019t either. It is not necessary to practice fumbling a few questions; most of us are nervous enough to do that naturally. Don\u2019t interrupt a good story because you have thought of a question, or because your narrator is straying from the planned outline. If the information is pertinent, let her go on, but jot down your question on your notepad so you will remember to ask it later. If your narrator does stray into subjects that are not pertinent (the most common problems are to follow some family member\u2019s children or to get into a series of family medical problems), try to pull her back as quickly as possible. \u201cBefore we move on, I\u2019d like to find out how the closing of the mine in 1935 affected your family\u2019s finances. Do you remember that?\u201d It is often hard for a narrator to describe people. An easy way to begin is to ask her to describe the person\u2019s appearance. From there, the narrator is more likely to move into character description. Don\u2019t switch the recorder off and on. It is much better to waste a little tape on irrelevant material than to call attention to the tape recorder by a constant on-off operation. Of course you can turn off the recorder if the telephone rings or if someone interrupts your session. Interviews, for beginning interviewers, usually work out better if there is no one present except the narrator and the interviewer. Sometimes two or more narrators can be successfully recorded, but usually each one of them would have been better alone. End the interview at a reasonable time. An hour and a half is probably the maximum. First, you must protect your narrator against over-fatigue; second, you will be tired even if she isn\u2019t. Some narrators tell you very frankly if they are tired, or their spouses will. Otherwise, you must plead fatigue, another appointment, or no more tape. Don\u2019t use the interview to show off your knowledge, vocabulary, charm, or other abilities. Good interviewers do not shine; only their interviews do. The next few tips are more focused on oral history work, but they apply to other kinds of research as well: Try to establish at every important point in the story where the narrator was or what her role was in this event, in order to indicate how much is eye-witness information and how much based on reports of others. \u201cWhere were you at the time of the mine disaster?\u201d \u201cDid you talk to any of the survivors later?\u201d Work around these questions carefully, so that you will not appear to be doubting the accuracy of the narrator\u2019s account. Do not challenge accounts you think might be inaccurate. Instead, try to develop as much information as possible that can be used by later researchers in establishing what probably happened. Your narrator may be telling you quite accurately what she saw. As Walter Lord explained when describing his interviews with survivors of the Titanic, \u201cEvery lady I interviewed had left the sinking ship in the last lifeboat. As I later found out from studying the placement of the lifeboats, no group of lifeboats was in view of another and each lady probably was in the last lifeboat she could see leaving the ship.\u201d Try to avoid \u201coff the record\u201d information\u2014the times when your narrator asks you to turn off the recorder while she tells you a good story. Ask her to let you record the whole things and promise that you will erase that portion if she asks you to after further consideration. You may have to erase it later, or she may not tell you the story at all, but once you allow \u201coff the record\u201d stories, she may continue with more and more, and you will end up with almost no recorded interview at all. \u201cOff the record\u201d information is only useful if you yourself are researching a subject and this is the only way you can get the information. It has no value if your purpose is to collect information for later use by other researchers.","title":"Interview Tips"},{"location":"guides/interview_tips/#interview-tips","text":"Collected below are a series of notes and/or prompts to asking better questions while doing documentary/ethnographic research.

Writing from a self-generated topic can be a little more difficult, but in the end you need to find ways to break your point into topics and then to remain on topic within a given paragraph: On what topic am I supposed to be writing? What do I know about this topic already? If I don\u2019t know how to respond to this topic, where can I go to find some answers? What does this topic mean to me? How do I relate to it? Step 2: Develop a Topic Sentence Before writing a paragraph, it is important to think first about the topic and then what you want to say about the topic. Most often, the topic is easy, but the question then turns to what you want to say about the topic. This concept is sometimes called the controlling idea. Strong paragraphs are typically about one main idea or topic, which is often explicitly stated in a topic sentence. Good topic sentences should always contain both (1) a topic and (2) a controlling idea. The topic is the main subject matter or idea covered in the paragraph. The controlling idea focuses the topic by providing direction to the composition. Read the following topic sentences. They all contain a topic (in bold) and a controlling idea (in italics). When your paragraphs contain a clearly stated topic sentence such as one of the following, your reader will know what to expect and, therefore, understand your ideas better. Examples of topic sentences: People can avoid plagiarizing by taking certain precautions . There are several advantages to online education . Effective leadership requires specific qualities that anyone can develop . Step 3: Demonstrate Your Point After stating your topic sentence, you need to provide information to prove, illustrate, clarify, and/or exemplify your point. Ask yourself: What examples can I use to support my point? What information can I provide to help clarify my thoughts? How can I support my point with specific data, experiences, or other factual material? What information does the reader need to know in order to see my point? Here is a list of the kinds of information you can add to your paragraph: Facts, details, reasons, examples Information from the readings or class discussions Paraphrases or short quotations Statistics, polls, percentages, data from research studies Personal experience, stories, anecdotes, examples from your life Sometimes, adding transitional or introductory phrases like: for example, for instance, first, second, or last can help guide the reader. Also, make sure you are citing your sources appropriately. Step 4: Give Your Paragraph Meaning After you have given the reader enough information to see and understand your point, you need to explain why this information is relevant, meaningful, or interesting. Ask yourself: What does the provided information mean? How does it relate to your overall point, argument, or thesis? Why is this information important/significant/meaningful? How does this information relate to the assignment or course I am taking? Step 5: Conclude After illustrating your point with relevant information, add a concluding sentence. Concluding sentences link one paragraph to the next and provide another device for helping you ensure your paragraph is unified. While not all paragraphs include a concluding sentence, you should always consider whether one is appropriate. Concluding sentences have two crucial roles in paragraph writing: First, they draw together the information you have presented to elaborate your controlling idea by: Summarizing the point(s) you have made. Repeating words or phrases from the topic sentence. Using linking words that indicate that conclusions are being drawn (e.g., therefore, thus, resulting). Second, they often link the current paragraph to the following paragraph. They may anticipate the topic sentence of the next paragraph by: Introducing a word/phrase or new concept which will then be picked up in the topic sentence of the next paragraph. Using words or phrases that point ahead (e.g., the following, another, other). Step 6: Read and Revise The last step in good paragraph writing is proofreading and revision. Before you submit your writing, look over your work at least one more time. Try reading your paragraph outloud to make sure it makes sense. Also, ask yourself these questions: Does my paragraph answer the prompt and support my thesis? Does it make sense? Does it use the appropriate academic voice? Introductory Paragraphs Defining a Term In his introduction to his essay on \u201cTradition,\u201d Henry Glassie establishes that defining a term need not term to external source but can be conjured out of what he and his audience already know and believe to be neccesarily true: Accept, to begin, that tradition is the creation of the future out of the past. A continuous process situated in the nothingness of the present, linking the vanished with the unknown, tradition is stopped, parceled, and codified by thinkers who fix upon this aspect or that, in accord with their needs or preoccupations, and leave us with a scatter of apparently contradictory, yet cogent, definitions. More important, I believe, than erecting and polishing a new definition, which would but stand as a monument to the worries of our unmemorable era, is developing an understanding of the concept in the breadth of its semantic extent. Widening into an embrace of the many ways people convert the old into the new, tradition spreads into association with adjacent, related, equally indispensable terms. Our understanding begins as we refine tradition in conjunction with history and culture. (Glassie 1995: 395) Richard Bauman does not define a term in the introduction to his essay on \u201cThe La Have Island General Store.\u201d Instead he discusses its current usage and how it might warrant expansion. He also, like Robinson does, uses a pas de deux approach and saves the articulation of his focus for the second paragraph. ONE OF THE ROCKS on which the ethnography of speaking is built is that the role of speaking in culture and society is cross-culturally variable and diverse. For some peoples, speaking will be the focus of a high degree of interest, elaboration, and evaluation, while in other groups it will receive relatively little conscious attention. A major part of our collective ethnographic task is to establish the full range of variability in this sphere. Despite this charter, however, there has been a clear bias in our work toward the groups in which speaking is a cultural focus; either we become interested in the ethnography of speaking because language turns out to be quite important in a group we are working on, or we make our choices of groups in which to do ethnographies of speaking on the basis of the apparent importance of speaking in their culture because time for research is be- coming ever more precious. Certainly both sets of factors have entered into my own decisions to work on the Quakers and the Vincentians. To be sure, we do have a few glimpses of the other side of the coin, as in Peter Gardner\u2019s description of the Paliyans, for example,\u2019 but note how often this case must be cited as the one example of a group with a minimal and negative concern for language because we have no others.2 If we are to avoid skewing the still de- veloping field of inquiry in which we are engaged, we need to start bringing in accounts of more sociolinguistically modest groups together with their more talkative brethren, with a view toward the larger goal of constructing typologies of the role of speaking in culture and society. My own introductory paragraph, like Glassie\u2019s above, seeks to suggest an intellectual history for a term: \u201cTalking shit\u201d is a venerable tradition in many African American speech communities. As an umbrella term, it typically covers only a particular portfolio of genres, both in day-to-day as well as in analytical uses. In performance, individual speakers deploy forms that are largely made up of reported speech, reflecting an understanding of authorship as diffused in the space of the fictive present as well as across performances reaching back to the historical past. A close examination of the forms involved in fact reveals that not only are texts generated, variously, in dialogue but that they are constructed of dialogue as well, creating a continuum across semantic and pragmatic domains which speakers use to great effect. This study, located in a small south Louisiana town, highlights the flexible nature of the genres involved, allowing speakers to move into and out of the performance frame, which is itself sometimes considered a dimension of the performance. Sketching a Scene Dropping your reader into the middle of a scene that dramatizes some aspect of what you are about to analyze is another way to write an introduction. Consider the following scenario: Three months or so before the release of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, a reader gets online, locates Amazon. com, and, typing in the title of the seventh novel, pulls up the exact timing of its release (July 21, 2007), the package deals featuring the first six Potter novels, as well as industry and customer buzz about the series\u2019 final installment. Having logged on seeking specific information about Hallows, our reader is pleasantly surprised to discover that Amazon has already done much of the looking for her and has placed its results at the Harry Potter Store, one of only two stores on the site devoted to a single series.1 There, just a click away from Amazon\u2019s home page, she finds that the novels reside alongside the site\u2019s own version of Pottermania\u2014trivia quizzes, film updates and interviews, an ever-increasing stock of paraphernalia, testimonials, message board discussions, and blog accounts. There, too, she learns that the store acts as a kind of Potter impresario, sponsoring special features from Kid Correspondents, to the Owl Delivery Writing Adventure, to the Harry-est Town in America.2 Before she leaves the site, our reader bookmarks the Harry Potter Store. She plans on returning. (Wu 2010: 190) Some years ago, I found myself touring the city of Cincinnati with a friend and as we drove through one particular neighborhood she identi\u00adfied it in a twofold fashion: it was a \u201chillbilly\u201d neighborhood and it was dangerous \u2013 one being the product of another. While I was dismayed by my friend\u2019s characterization, since she was a recent transplant to the city herself, I understood her remark to be drawn from received wisdom, a term used loosely in this context. What intrigued me more as a student of material culture and vernacular architecture was what I actually saw: significantly different uses of urban spaces. I wanted to find out for my\u00adself what was going on, and so at my first opportunity I began doing fieldwork in which a series of encounters led me to Charlie Kraft, a self\u00ad-identified urban Appalachian.

Other kinds of \u201ctexts\u201d are not off-limits, but they do, in having different dimensions, present different issues when it comes to data capture. While we must recognize that there is more to any text than simply its words and the vocal medium in which it is conveyed \u2013 that is, the linguistic and paralinguistic dimensions of a spoken text \u2013 it is also the case that written texts and audio recordings are much smaller in size than video recordings, and much easier to handle as a result, thus much of this particular guide is focused on audio software and hardware. Software For most of us, the voice memo app that comes with most smart phones will do the trick, so long as your clear on how to get recordings off the device: in most instances, it should be fairly easy to email the recording to yourself, or, in the case of the Voice Memos app in iOS, to sync them to off-device storage. (iOS\u2019s Voice Memos will sync audio files to the Notes application, for example, which you should then be able to open on your Mac, provided you have a Mac and you have signed up for their iCloud service.) There are a lot of other sound recording apps available for smart phones. I have used a few, including both FiRe (Field Recorder) and CaptureAudio. I use the latter more often these days, but both are fine. I prefer to use dedicated audio recording apps because they allow you to choose the format in which you record your audio. Like almost all digital media formats, audio recordings come in both uncompressed, or \u201craw\u201d, and compressed forms. Most of you are familiar with, and indeed rely upon, a compressed format known as MP3. For my own fieldwork, when it is my research (and my reputation) on the line, I use an uncompressed format known as AIFF. See the note about CODECS below. Hardware Some of you may own and use, or have a friend or family member who uses, a dedicated camera, either a point and shoot or what is known as a DSLR. You are thus familiar with the idea that while the audio capture capabilities of your smart phone is \u201cgood enough\u201d for most purposes, it is not terribly good at it in particular. There are a couple of ways to improve this situation, and they involve purchasing additional equipment (or hardware). Microphones The simplest, and least expensive, option to enhance your audio recording capabilities is to purchase a microphone: almost any external microphone will be better than the one built into your smart phone, which, to be honest, wasn\u2019t chosen for the quality of its audio capture so much as its ability to fit into the small case of your phone and that it didn\u2019t cost very much. Please be careful when buying a microphone to purchase the appropriate cable that will link it to your device. Most professional recording equipment uses a grounded connection known as XLR, which is a three-prong connector. Most consumer devices, especially small devices, use an eighth-inch or \u201cmini\u201d jack with a TRS (Tip-Ring-Sleeve) or TRRS (Tip-Ring-Ring-Sleeve) arrangement for stereo audio input and output. (And do be aware that an XLR to mini-jack cable loses its grounded nature, which means that other electrical fields in an environment can affect your recording.) Recorders Moving away from using your smart phone, the next step you can take is to invest in a separate device. I generally advise against this for a couple of reasons: mostly because with a good microphone and a good audio recording application, your smart phone or tablet or computer is an awfully good portable sound studio and one you already own. (So, something you already own is good, and, perhaps just as importantly, something you already carry around.) For some, however, a separate device is preferable. Perhaps your phone is really old, or maybe it\u2019s already crammed full of data and apps \u2013 remember, using any device to capture data means you are going to increase your storage needs. Or perhaps you would just have a separate device to do this kind of thing. If that\u2019s the case, then I have a couple of suggestions to make. Let me begin with the device that I use, an Roland R-09 recorder, which is no longer available, but the Roland R-05 is, and it is cheaper and better than the R-09. Both units have built-in microphones that are better than most smart phones, and they are both lightweight and dependable. They both also use widely available standard batteries (2 AA) and SD cards. You can plug an external microphone, and you can also attach either device directly to your computer for transferring files via a USB mini cable. Smaller in size, and in price, than the Roland units and also widely popular is the TASCAM DR-05 . The TASCAM DR-05 gives you much the same functionality and flexibility. Most people I know who use one don\u2019t even bother to use a microphone, but the unit does accept one. Both of these devices make it dead simple, thanks to their removable media, to move your audio recordings from the device itself to your computer. That\u2019s an important feature. Less expensive devices can sometimes make this more difficult. Here\u2019s a quick summary of other options: The Olympus voice recorders, like the Olympus VN-2700 for example, are very inexpensive and work well \u2013 but you must remember to turn off voice activation! \u2013 but getting the recordings off the device requires some work on the user\u2019s part. (And it\u2019s not a digital transfer but a matter of playing the audio into the computer.) The SONY ICD PX333 Digital Voice Recorder uses AAA batteries and removable media, but it only records in mono MP3 format. (That\u2019s an allowable option for this class, and for voice recording in general, but it is a limitation, and the Sony is a little more expensive.) The iGearPro Voice Activated Audio Recorder does allow you to turn the voice activation off, and it also allows you to connect the device directly to your computer in order to transfer files from the device. I have never used the MaxPro-Best USB Flash Drive Voice Recorder but it looks dead simple and it\u2019s very inexpensive.","title":"Recording Hardware and Software"},{"location":"guides/recording/#recording-gear","text":"Because this is a class within a literature department, we are focused mostly on verbal texts.

Perhaps your phone is really old, or maybe it\u2019s already crammed full of data and apps \u2013 remember, using any device to capture data means you are going to increase your storage needs. Or perhaps you would just have a separate device to do this kind of thing. If that\u2019s the case, then I have a couple of suggestions to make. Let me begin with the device that I use, an Roland R-09 recorder, which is no longer available, but the Roland R-05 is, and it is cheaper and better than the R-09. Both units have built-in microphones that are better than most smart phones, and they are both lightweight and dependable. They both also use widely available standard batteries (2 AA) and SD cards. You can plug an external microphone, and you can also attach either device directly to your computer for transferring files via a USB mini cable. Smaller in size, and in price, than the Roland units and also widely popular is the TASCAM DR-05 . The TASCAM DR-05 gives you much the same functionality and flexibility. Most people I know who use one don\u2019t even bother to use a microphone, but the unit does accept one. Both of these devices make it dead simple, thanks to their removable media, to move your audio recordings from the device itself to your computer. That\u2019s an important feature. Less expensive devices can sometimes make this more difficult. Here\u2019s a quick summary of other options: The Olympus voice recorders, like the Olympus VN-2700 for example, are very inexpensive and work well \u2013 but you must remember to turn off voice activation! \u2013 but getting the recordings off the device requires some work on the user\u2019s part. (And it\u2019s not a digital transfer but a matter of playing the audio into the computer.) The SONY ICD PX333 Digital Voice Recorder uses AAA batteries and removable media, but it only records in mono MP3 format. (That\u2019s an allowable option for this class, and for voice recording in general, but it is a limitation, and the Sony is a little more expensive.) The iGearPro Voice Activated Audio Recorder does allow you to turn the voice activation off, and it also allows you to connect the device directly to your computer in order to transfer files from the device. I have never used the MaxPro-Best USB Flash Drive Voice Recorder but it looks dead simple and it\u2019s very inexpensive.","title":"Recorders"},{"location":"guides/writing/","text":"On Writing While the subjects you encounter in my classes may be literature or folklore or even just raw data, my goal is to teach you to gather data into information and to process information into knowledge.

And when harvest time came, the apples on this tree were all as red as blood. The three daughters went every day beneath the tree, and looked to see if the wind had not blown down an apple, but they never by any chance found one, and the tree was so loaded with them that it was almost breaking, and the branches hung down to the ground. Then the King\u2019s youngest child had a great desire for an apple, and said to her sisters, \u201cOur father loves us far too much to wish us underground, it is my belief that he would only do that to people who were strangers.\u201d And while she was speaking, the child plucked off quite a large apple, and ran to her sisters, saying, \u201cJust taste, my dear little sisters, for never in my life have I tasted anything so delightful.\u201d Then the two other sisters also ate some of the apple, whereupon all three sank deep down into the earth, where they could hear no cock crow. When mid-day came, the King wished to call them to come to dinner, but they were nowhere to be found. He sought them everywhere in the palace and garden, but could not find them. Then he was much troubled, and made known to the whole land that whosoever brought his daughters back again should have one of them to wife. Hereupon so many young men went about the country in search, that there was no counting them, for every one loved the three children because they were so kind to all, and so fair of face. Three young huntsmen also went out, and when they had travelled about for eight days, they arrived at a great castle, in which were beautiful apartments, and in one room a table was laid on which were delicate dishes which were still so warm that they were smoking, but in the whole of the castle no human being was either to be seen or heard. They waited there for half a day, and the food still remained warm and smoking, and at length they were so hungry that they sat down and ate, and agreed with each other that they would stay and live in that castle, and that one of them, who should be chosen by casting lots, should remain in the house, and the two others seek the King\u2019s daughters. They cast lots, and the lot fell on the eldest; so next day the two younger went out to seek, and the eldest had to stay home. At mid-day came a small, small mannikin and begged for a piece of bread, then the huntsman took the bread which he had found there, and cut a round off the loaf and was about to give it to him, but whilst he was giving it to the mannikin, the latter let it fall, and asked the huntsman to be so good as to give him that piece again. The huntsman was about to do so and stooped, on which the mannikin took a stick, seized him by the hair, and gave him a good beating. Next day, the second stayed at home, and he fared no better. When the two others returned in the evening, the eldest said, \u201cWell, how have you got on?\u201d \u201cOh, very badly,\u201d said he, and then they lamented their misfortune together, but they said nothing about it to the youngest, for they did not like him at all, and always called him Stupid Hans, because he did not exactly belong to the forest. On the third day, the youngest stayed at home, and again the little mannikin came and begged for a piece of bread. When the youth gave it to him, the elf let it fall as before, and asked him to be so good as to give him that piece again. Then said Hans to the little mannikin, \u201cWhat! canst thou not pick up that piece thyself? If thou wilt not take as much trouble as that for thy daily bread, thou dost not deserve to have it.\u201d Then the mannikin grew very angry and said he was to do it, but the huntsman would not, and took my dear mannikin, and gave him a thorough beating. Then the mannikin screamed terribly, and cried, \u201cStop, stop, and let me go, and I will tell thee where the King\u2019s daughters are.\u201d When Hans heard that, he left off beating him and the mannikin told him that he was an earth mannikin, and that there were more than a thousand like him, and that if he would go with him he would show him where the King\u2019s daughters were. Then he showed him a deep well, but there was no water in it. And the elf said that he knew well that the companions Hans had with him did not intend to deal honourably with him, therefore if he wished to deliver the King\u2019s children, he must do it alone. The two other brothers would also be very glad to recover the King\u2019s daughters, but they did not want to have any trouble or danger. Hans was therefore to take a large basket, and he must seat himself in it with his hanger and a bell, and be let down. Below were three rooms, and in each of them was a princess, with a many-headed dragon, whose heads she was to comb and trim, but he must cut them off. And having said all this, the elf vanished. When it was evening the two brothers came and asked how he had got on, and he said, \u201cpretty well so far,\u201d and that he had seen no one except at mid-day when a little mannikin had come and begged for a piece of bread, that he had given some to him, but that the mannikin had let it fall and had asked him to pick it up again; but as he did not choose to do that, the elf had begun to lose his temper, and that he had done what he ought not, and had given the elf a beating, on which he had told him where the King\u2019s daughters were. Then the two were so angry at this that they grew green and yellow. Next morning they went to the well together, and drew lots who should first seat himself in the basket, and again the lot fell on the eldest, and he was to seat himself in it, and take the bell with him. Then he said, \u201cIf I ring, you must draw me up again immediately.\u201d When he had gone down for a short distance, he rang, and they at once drew him up again. Then the second seated himself in the basket, but he did just the same as the first, and then it was the turn of the youngest, but he let himself be lowered quite to the bottom. When he had got out of the basket, he took his hanger, and went and stood outside the first door and listened, and heard the dragon snoring quite loudly. He opened the door slowly, and one of the princesses was sitting there, and had nine dragon\u2019s heads lying upon her lap, and was combing them. Then he took his hanger and hewed at them, and the nine fell off. The princess sprang up, threw her arms round his neck, embraced and kissed him repeatedly, and took her stomacher, which was made of pure gold, and hung it round his neck. Then he went to the second princess, who had a dragon with five heads to comb, and delivered her also, and to the youngest, who had a dragon with four heads, he went likewise. And they all rejoiced, and embraced him and kissed him without stopping. Then he rang very loud, so that those above heard him, and he placed the princesses one after the other in the basket, and had them all drawn up, but when it came to his own turn he remembered the words of the elf, who had told him that his comrades did not mean well by him. So he took a great stone which was lying there, and placed it in the basket, and when it was about half way up, his false brothers above cut the rope, so that the basket with the stone fell to the ground, and they thought that he was dead, and ran away with the three princesses, making them promise to tell their father that it was they who had delivered them, and then they went to the King, and each demanded a princess in marriage. In the meantime the youngest huntsman was wandering about the three chambers in great trouble, fully expecting to have to end his days there, when he saw, hanging on the wall, a flute; then said he, \u201cWhy dost thou hang there, no one can be merry here?\u201d He looked at the dragons, heads likewise and said, \u201cYou too cannot help me now.\u201d He walked backwards and forwards for such a long time that he made the surface of the ground quite smooth. But at last other thoughts came to his mind, and he took the flute from the wall, and played a few notes on it, and suddenly a number of elves appeared, and with every note that he sounded one more came. Then he played until the room was entirely filled. They all asked what he desired, so he said he wished to get above ground back to daylight, on which they seized him by every hair that grew on his head, and thus they flew with him onto the earth again. When he was above ground, he at once went to the King\u2019s palace, just as the wedding of one princess was about to be celebrated, and he went to the room where the King and his three daughters were. When the princesses saw him they fainted. Hereupon the King was angry, and ordered him to be put in prison at once, because he thought he must have done some injury to the children. When the princesses came to themselves, however, they entreated the King to set him free again. The King asked why, and they said that they were not allowed to tell that, but their father said that they were to tell it to the stove. And he went out, listened at the door, and heard everything. Then he caused the two brothers to be hanged on the gallows, and to the third he gave his youngest daughter, and on that occasion I wore a pair of glass shoes, and I struck them against a stone, and they said, \u201cKlink,\u201d and were broken.","title":"Grimms 91"},{"location":"texts/hicks_2/","text":"This one is about Jack and Tom and Will\u2014of old Fire Dragon that spit balls of fire. And Jack\u2019s dad had a great bug track of land, owned it. So, he give it to Jack and Tom and Will to clear; give \u2018em the land and made \u2018em a deed for it, to clear and start clearing it theirselves. And so, they got up a wagon-load of vittles and went where it was at and built \u2018em a \u2026notched \u2018em up a shanty to stay in. And so, they knowed that the next\u2026that, when they got ready to clear it, that they\u2019d have to leave, uh, leave one till twelve (and he could help, then, after twelve) to cook dinner. So they left Will the first time. And Jack and Tom cleared, and Will got dinner and rung the dinner\u2026blowed the dinner horn. And, just when he blowed it, up out of a holler come old Fire Dragon, up with his pipe in his mouth, and come in at the door. And just come on in. And Will had the dinner set on the table, and he come in and never said a word to Will. And Will was so scared he hid behind the door. And Fire Dragon eat every bite, sopped the dish, and went back through in by the fireplace and got the biggest chunk of fire that he could find and stuffed down in his pipe and went off. And Jack and Tom got to the house, come in, and says, (Will shot out from behind the door), says, \u201cWhere is the dinner, Will?\u201d Says, \u201cHain\u2019t you cooked no dinner?\u201d He says, \u201cGosh,\u201d says, \u201cif you\u2019d a seed what I seed,\u201d said, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t want no dinner!\u201d And they \u2018gin to laugh, and Will says, \u201cAll right, laughing\u2019s catching,\u201d he says. \u201cTom,\u201d says, \u201ctomorrow\u2019ll be your turn.\u201d And so they fixed up a little, right quick, extra, then, and eat it, and went back and cleared that evening.

And said that beat any cloud of smoke, when he give that a few puffs, he ever seed in his life. And said he just struck out behind him then; follered him by the smoke down through a wilderness, way down in a holler. And while he had gone, Jack had\u2026While Jack was gone, Will and Tom come in and said, \u201cGood gracious!\u201d Says, \u201cThe dinner\u2019s on the table.\u201d Said, \u201cHe\u2019s eat Jack this time.\u201d Said, \u201cBoy, we\u2019ve lost Jack;\u201d said, \u201che\u2019s eat him.\u201d Said, \u201cThe dinner\u2019s on the table.\u201d Well, so Jack come in, directly.

And they eat and fixed \u2018em a basket out of splits and took and made \u2018em a rope out of hickory bark and went down to the hole. And they let Will down first. And they fixed it\u2026Will\u2026if that Will hit any trouble, he was to shake the rope of the hickory bark. And so, just hadn\u2019t went down but just a few feet till Will shook it and they snaked him back out just as fast as they could and they says, \u201cWhat did you see, Will?\u201d He said, \u201cI seed a house under there.\u201d And so they put Tom in it then, and let him down, and he was gone down just a little longer and he shook it and they jerked him out and says, \u201cTom, what did you see?\u201d He said, \u201cI seed a house and barn.\u201d And so they put Jack in then and let him down, and Jack let \u2018em let on down till he hit on the top of the roof. And he let it ease on down and he slid of the eaves. And he let it ease on down in the yard. And so he got out of the basket and went and pecked on the door. And a girl come; the oldest girl, which he didn\u2019t know it, when he pecked. And he says, \u201cHowdy.\u201d And she was so pretty till he just started in talking courting right when he seed her. And she says, \u201cOh,\u201d says, \u201cdon\u2019t do that!\u201d Said, \u201cThe second room you come to,\u201d said, \u201chas got one in it prettier than I am.\u201d And so Jack went on in and seed her and she was so much prettier till the first word he spoke was courting, wanting to court. And she says, \u201cOh, don\u2019t do that!\u201d She said, \u201cThe third one, in the third room,\u201d she said, \u201cis a beauty.\u201d Said, \u201cShe\u2019s the prettiest one of the bunch.\u201d So Jack went on in and seed her, and he just got to talking about getting married, she was so pretty. And so, she \u2018posed to him and tied a ribbon in her hair, and she put a wishing ring on his finger. And so told him that the Fire Dragon was a-coming back any minute. And said, \u201cHere\u2019s some ointment;\u201d said, \u201cIf he hits you with any if them fire-balls,\u201d says, \u201cthey burn a streak!\u201d And says, \u201cHere\u2019s a sword,\u201d said, \u201cis all that\u2019ll hurt him is a silver sword.\u201d Well, so Jack took the ointment and, in just a few minutes, the Fire Dragon come in and seed him and \u2018gin to make at him and spit them fire-balls. Said it was a sight to see them sparkle over the floor. And he dodged him around and some would glance him and burn him, and he\u2019d rub that ointment right quick, and try to get a lick with that sword. And said, directly, he got a lick and just swiped his head slick off. Well, he then fixed up to get the girls out of there. And he put the first one in the basket, that he met when he knocked on the door, and sent her up\u2014or shook the hickory rope and they pulled it up. And Will and Tom got to jarring off of it; said, \u201cThis one\u2019s mine!\u201d Directly she says, \u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d Says, \u201cThe next one is a-coming is prettier yet than I am.\u201d And so they shoved the basket back down in quick as they could, and Jack put the second one in it and shook the hickory rope and they flounced her out, and he heard \u2018em a raring over her. And said Will said, \u201cGood gosh, don\u2019t you put your hands on her; that one\u2019s mine.\u201d Tom said, \u201cDon\u2019t you touch her; that one\u2019s mine.\u201d She says, \u201cOh,\u201d says, \u201cdon\u2019t do that.\u201d Says, \u201cThe third one, the last one that\u2019s down there, is a beauty.\u201d Said, \u201cShe\u2019s the top.\u201d And so they shoved the basket down as quick as they could, and that was Jack\u2019s\u2014they\u2019d done \u2018posed to be married and had the ribbon in her hair. And so Jack out her in the basket. And Will and Tom, she was so much prettier, they got to fighting around over her. And she says, \u201cDon\u2019t fight.\u201d Says, \u201cI\u2019m done supposed to be married to Jack.\u201d They said, \u201cWell,\u201d \u2013 just pitched the hickory rope and the basket right down in the hole\u2014and said, \u201clet the rascal stay down in there.\u201d And said, \u201cHe\u2019ll not get you.\u201d And so they took \u2018em and went back to the new ground shanty. And Jack stayed in there and eat all the rations up that the Fire Dragon had, he thought. And he stayed a week or two. And, directly, he got to getting weak, and he hunted around and he found a few more bites to eat, a little more. And he got to feeling so weak, till he looked down and\u2026looking at his fingers to see how much he\u2019d fell off, what time he\u2019d been down in there. And he looked, and his fingers was fell off, and the made him notice the ring. Hit was so loose it would fall off his fingers, from the time he\u2019d been in there. And that made him think about the ring, and he said, \u201cI wish I was home with my mother, a-setting in the chimley corner, a-smoking my old \u2018kachuckety\u2019 (?) pipe.\u201d And said, just as the words got out of his mouth, there he was a-setting, and his mother a-talking to him. She said, \u201cJack,\u201d she said, \u201clooks like you ought to be to the new ground a-helping Tom and Will clear.\u201d He says, \u201cBedad, that\u2019s where I\u2019m started.\u201d And so he got on up there and they had the three girls and was still a-fighting over them. And so, him and the youngest one, the prettiest one, married\u2014that had put the ring on his finger\u2014and the ribbon was in her hair yet. And her and Jack married, and Tom married the next one to her, and Jack\u2026ah, Will had to take the oldest. And the last time that I was around there, they\u2019d built more shanties and they was a-doing well.","title":"Hicks 2"}]}
