<h3 id="matters-of-fact">Matters of "Fact"</h3>
<p>As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Day_the_Universe_Changed">Wikipedia</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The Day the Universe Changed</em> is a British documentary television series written and presented by science historian James Burke, originally broadcast on BBC1 in [Spring] 1985 by the BBC [and rebroadcast on PBS in Autumn 1986]. The series' primary focus is on the effect of advances in science and technology on western society in its philosophical aspects. The title comes from the philosophical idea that the universe essentially only exists as one perceives it through what one knows; therefore, if one changes one's perception of the universe with new knowledge, one has essentially changed the universe itself. To illustrate this concept, James Burke tells the various stories of important scientific discoveries and technological advances and how they fundamentally altered how western civilization perceives the world. The series runs in roughly chronological order, from around the beginning of the Middle Ages to the present.</p>

<p>If you're observant, then you might have noticed that Langlois' essay is tagged as part of JSTOR's <a href="https://www.jstor.org/security-studies/">Security Studies</a> collection.

<h3 id="legends-as-performances">Legends as Performances</h3>
<p>In addition to thinking about folklore <em>qua</em> texts, folklorists have also developed a robust model of folklore as transactional in nature: folklore was "equipment for living" (Kenneth Burke) or folklore as a way to get social business done. Some describe this as a contextual approach, but the term most often associated with it is performance. The articles below focus on the nature of contexts:</p>

<p>To understand the what we think of as the information age, we'll need to go back a bit and make sure we understand the previous era, The Media Age, for lack of a better name. And that's why we begin with Marshal McLuhan.</p>

<p>Greste, Peter. 2017. <em>Facebook: Cracking the Code</em>. ThoughtMaybe. <a href="https://thoughtmaybe.com/facebook-cracking-the-code/">Link</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facebook is an enormously powerful corporation, harnessing both the self-disclosed and gleaned personal data of over 2 billion people. Its user-base is larger than the population of any country. The company is all pervasive online, tracking and profiling users and non-users alike. Cracking the Code looks at the insides of this giant machine and how Facebook turns your thoughts and behaviours into profits—whether you like it or not. And it’s not just a one-way transaction either. Cracking the Code also explains how Facebook uses vast troves of web data to manipulate the way you think and feel, as well as act—all in the sole interests of Facebook, masquerading as “community.” What are the social implications of this—when one company basically controls the insights and experiences of the entire online world, with extremely personalised and targeted social and behavioural engineering on a scale never before seen?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are experiencing a fundamental paradigm shift in our relationship to knowledge. From the ‘information age’, we are moving towards the ‘reputation age’, in which information will have value only if it is already filtered, evaluated and commented upon by others. Seen in this light, reputation has become a central pillar of collective intelligence today. It is the gatekeeper to knowledge, and the keys to the gate are held by others. The way in which the authority of knowledge is now constructed makes us reliant on what are the inevitably biased judgments of other people, most of whom we do not know.</p>

<p>As a nice follow-up to the Satanic Cult legends that were widely popular in the U.S.A. during the late eighties, and continue to bubble up even to the present moment, take a look at this <a href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-satanic-crime-fighting-tips-a-real-police-training-video/">post on <em>Cracked</em></a>.

### Joking and Socializing

To go along with our reading of Zora Neale Hurston's _Mules and Men_:

* Hurston singing ["Uncle Bud"](http://biblioklept.org/2009/02/27/zora-neale-hurston-sings-uncle-bud/). And here's Boozoo Chavis singing ["Uncle Bud"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEgbfXdzb28), keeping the ribald nature of the song alive and well. (Feel free to click on the links for live versions of the song, including one by, I think, a Japanese zydeco band.)
* And a collection of Hurston singing [a variety of folk songs](https://www.floridamemory.com/audio/hurston.php).
* When Zora sings in Polk County she sings ["John Henry"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_(folklore))(link is to Wikipedia article for those who don't know the story/history of the song.) If you want to see what railroad looked like throughout much of the twentieth century, especially in the South, have a look at ["Gandy Dancers'](https://youtu.be/3r_cI3kYYhM), a 1973 film documentary.
* If you don't know what a work song sounds like, then this version of ["Rosie"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RmMyPVLqyzE), recorded by the Lomaxes at Mississippi State Prison in Parchman is as good a place as any to start understanding a much broader folk song tradition than we will have time to address in this course.
* There is also this upload of Bill Ferris' ["I Ain't Lying"](https://youtu.be/Smwr24UCRXo). Watch the first five minutes at least.


### Impersonations

If you consider the root of impersonation, you are confronted with the idea of being in another person for the sake, quite often, of humor. But, as the Apache point out, no matter what your intent, there are always multiple possibilities whenever you dwell elsewhere. (In some way, the argument for reading is that by being (in) others while reading, we are allowing ourselves to imagine, simultaneously, what it is like to be someone else *and* what it is like not to be ourselves. Both of those are very powerful questions -- and that is why, perhaps, we usually contain impersonations within a humorous frame.

For the next class, please read the following four pieces, three of which are really quite short. Only the Dundes is an essay-long consideration of ethnic humor. The short note that follows the Dundes below, considers how the light bulb joke begins in ethnic humor but visits other topics.

Please read in the order listed:

Welsch, Roger. 1967. American Numskull Tales: The Polack Joke. _Western Folklore_ 26/3: 183-186. [JSTOR](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1498447).

Wukasch, Charles. 1969. American Numskull Tales: The Aggie Joke. _Western Folklore_ 28/3: 214-215. [JSTOR](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1499269).

Dundes, Alan. 1971. A Study of Ethnic Slurs: The Jew and the Polack in the United States. _Journal of American Folklore_ 84/332: 186-203. [JSTOR](http://www.jstor.org/stable/538989).

Kerman , Judith. 1980. The Light-Bulb Jokes: Americans Look at Social Action Processes. _Journal of American Folklore_ 93/370: 454-458.[JSTOR](http://www.jstor.org/stable/539876).

Accents, in speech, can be considered one facet of stereotypes. Here are some [Irish people doing North American accents](https://youtu.be/JVjL0i74Drw).



*I think we are going to skip this next session on treasure legends and go to contemporary legends, what are often called "urban legends" or "urban myths."*

### Treasure Tales

This essay from Hurley represents folklore scholarship from the late forties. Be aware that there is some outdated language here. The essay itself is only 8 pages long. The rest of the entry is 102 summaries of treasure tales.

Hurley, Gerard T. 1951. Buried Treasure Tales in America. _Western Folklore_ 10/3: 197-216. [JSTOR](http://www.jstor.org/stable/1496333).

Mullen introduces us to the notion of a "folk idea", something we will explore in the weeks ahead.

Mullen, Patrick B. 1978. The Folk Idea of Unlimited Good in American Buried Treasure Legends. _Journal of the Folklore Institute_ 15/3: 209-220. [JSTOR](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3813976).

This is the one time that I will, as a professor, make you read my own writing. I am doing so both because our topic is treasure legends and the paper offered here is on Louisiana treasure legends but also because as something written early in the stages of a research project it has plenty of flaws and gaps.
