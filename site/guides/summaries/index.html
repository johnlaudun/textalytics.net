            <h1 id="in-sum">In Sum</h1>
<p>While you may view summaries as exercises performed strictly for the satisfaction of your instructor, the fact is that summaries are singularly useful reports that you write to yourself. You write a summary of a text so that you don&rsquo;t have to read a text again later, when you are either being examined or when you are writing your own analysis. A good summary is &ldquo;one and done.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="quickly">Quickly</h2>
<ol>
<li>Be clear on the purpose for the summary: what do you need it to do?</li>
<li>As you read, or better re-read, mark sentences that seem to present the &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; or the &ldquo;gist&rdquo; or &ldquo;the point.&rdquo;</li>
<li>What are the text&rsquo;s main ideas? Sometimes, oh sometimes, the text does not necessarily make its main ideas clear: you will have to extrapolate. The good news is that such extrapolations will necessarily be in your own words, i.e. paraphrased.</li>
<li>Analyze the part of the text in relation to the whole &ndash; when it comes to non-fiction texts, <a href="../says_does/">says-does analyses</a> can be useful here. Be sure your assessment of what is important is what the text itself is signalling as important. (And if the text says one thing and does another, that is worth describing.)</li>
<li>Just as importantly, sometimes what&rsquo;s important to you is different from what is important to the text. Be sure to note your own <em>takeaways</em>.</li>
<li>Be objective! Injecting your opinion is not useful to you later. A summary is a report that attempts to be as true to the original text as possible.</li>
