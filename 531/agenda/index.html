<h3 id="a-bayesian-introduction-to-narrative-studies">A Bayesian Introduction to Narrative Studies</h3>
<p>The first task in any course with some dimension of intellectual history as its focus is to try to understand the overall history of the domain. Narrative, however, is a relatively recent locus for organizing scholarly and scientific investigation. Prior to its development as a subject of study in the twentieth century, narrative was largely viewed through a lens of other objects &ndash; tragic plays, novels, myths. While a seminar of this nature could spend a considerable amount of time in the period prior to the formalist-structuralist articulation of narrative as an object in its own right, we are going to bounce around a bit, hoping, in some shadow of Bayes, to locate ourselves through apparent random pings in the great depths of intellectual history.</p>
<p>We begin with two readings, one a narrative, and one a scholarly examination:</p>
<p>McConnell, Richard. 1924. The Most Dangerous Game. <em>Collier&rsquo;s</em>. [Moodle].</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For those interested in the sheer volume of adaptations of the story, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Most_Dangerous_Game">Wikipedia entry</a> for the short story has a decent, if not complete (because impossible), list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Schiffrin, Deborah. 2009. Crossing Boundaries: The Nexus of Time, Space, Person, and Place in Narrative. <em>Language in Society</em> 38 (4): 421–45. DOI:10.1017/S0047404509990212. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20622659">JSTOR</a>.</p>
<p>Burke, Kenneth. 1973/1941. Literature as Equipment for Living. In <em>The Philosophy of Literary Form</em>, 293-304. University of California Press. [Moodle].</p>
<p>Finally, before we leap into our own exploration of the development of narrative studies, it won&rsquo;t hurt to read some surveys and develop some sense of the larger landscape. For this, there are two encyclopedias, one you know and one you are less likely to know. The first entry for &ldquo;Narratology&rdquo; is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narratology">Wikipedia</a>, and the second in the <a href="https://www.lhn.uni-hamburg.de/article/narratology">Living Handbook of Narratology</a>. The former is short; the latter long.</p>
<h3 id="unitizing-narrative-motifs-functions">Unitizing Narrative: Motifs &amp; Functions</h3>
<p>Before we examine Propp&rsquo;s work, it&rsquo;s important to understand the larger dialogue in which he is engaging. Specifically, early in <em>Morphology</em>, Propp notes that &ldquo;the study of the tale has been pursued for the most part only genetically, and, to a great extent, without attempts at preliminary, systematic description&rdquo; (5). <em>Genetic</em> references the great philological collection projects of the nineteenth century that were, for the most part, focused on origins and originals. In the twentieth century, that focus would become what is now known as the historic-geographic method, and its most noted accomplishment are the great indices of folklore studies: the tale-type index and the motif index. The best way to understand them is to use them. (More on genetic matters below.)</p>
<h4 id="the-indices">The Indices</h4>
<p>The Aarne-Thompson-Uther classification system is available on-line as part of the <a href="http://www.mftd.org/index.php">Multilingual Folk Tale Database</a>. A concise explanation of the ATU system is offered <a href="http://oaks.nvg.org/folktale-types.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>In preparation for actually using the two iconic folklore indices, I would suggest the following reading:</p>
<p>Again, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_(folkloristics)">Wikipedia</a> is not a terrible place to start. And there are two other online sources that are worth your time:</p>
<p>Richard Kuehnel and Rado Lencek. <a href="https://www.aktuellum.com/mobile/slavic/folklore-motif/">What is a Folklore Motif?</a></p>
<p><a href="https://sites.ualberta.ca/~urban/Projects/English/Content/Motif_Help.htm">How to use Thompson&rsquo;s Folklore Motif Index</a></p>
<p>This seminar would be remiss if you did not read about the idea of <em>motif</em> from the compiler himself, Stith Thompson. I have also included Angela Maniak&rsquo;s short introduction to the role of the role of indexes, or indices, and bibliographies in classical forms of scholarship for those less acquainted with them. Finally, the long essay by Dan Ben-Amos is for those committed to understanding the nuances of folklore studies&rsquo; intellectual history.</p>
<p>Thompson, Stith. 1949. Motif. In <em>Standard Dictionary of Folklore, Mythology and Legend</em>, 753. Eds. Maria Leach and Jerome Fried. Funk and Wagnalls. [Moodle].</p>
<p>Maniak, Angela. 1983. Bibliographies and Indexes in American Folklore Research. In Handbook of American Folklore, ed. Richard Dorson, 447-451. Indiana University Press. [Moodle].</p>

<p>A slightly different approach to unitizing narrative, but proceeding along the same lines as the historic-geographic school, can be found in the work of <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/anthropology/staff/academic/?id=5388">Jamshid J. Tehrani</a>, who has parsed narratives into <em>traits</em> that look a lot like motifs and then attempted phylogenetic analysis on variations on a text to see which are more closely related. His analysis takes place against a backdrop of history and cultural geography.</p>

<h4 id="propp">Propp</h4>
<p>The intertwined, and yet not intersecting, history of motifs and functions is not one on which I can comment. Structuralists outside folklore studies never took up the motif, and folkorists, while fascinated with function, never developed the idea much. Propp&rsquo;s Morphology, however, has enjoyed a renaissance of late. (It is perhaps because the kinds of data and analysis needed for structuralism has finally come to be &ndash; see Miranda for more.)</p>
<p>Propp, Vladimir. 1968. <em>Morphology of the Folktale</em>. Tr. Laurence Scott. University of Texas Press. [Moodle].</p>
<p>And here are some <a href="../legends/">Louisiana legends</a> to consider. (For a text analytical perspective, the corpus is also on <a href="https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=542be74058f3710c6026a1e81a763502&amp;panels=collocatesgraph,reader,trends,summary,bubblelines">Voyant-Tools</a>)</p>
<p>Contemporary considerations of Propp include:</p>

<p>The motif is one of those things that seems old-fashioned and yet has renewed interest in the era of data science (for a variety of reasons). In computer science, <a href="https://users.cs.fiu.edu/~markaf/">Mark Finlayson</a> has done some remarkable work &ndash; see his profile page for a complete bibliography &ndash; but those works directly related to Propp are below. (Please note that computer science, like the sciences in general, is really good about making their work easily accessible: the obsession with tying any work up with protections is the best path to obscurity, literal and figurative.)

<p>For those familiar with Claude Lévi-Strauss, it might surprise you to learn that while his early work on kinship had established him in the academy, his rise to star status actually emerged from his memoir, <em>Tristes Tropiques</em>, published in the same year, 1955, as &ldquo;The Structural Study of Myth&rdquo; (below). The essay was one stepping stone &ndash; others are collected in <em>Structural Anthropology</em> &ndash; to his longer treatment of myth in <em>La Pensée Sauvage</em> (1964, translated as <em>The Savage Mind</em> in English, which, as is usual for translations of Levi-Strauss, and later Derrida, misses the linguistic play often at the heart of his writing).</p>

<h3 id="classical-narratology">Classical Narratology</h3>
<p>While we will return to the idea that narratives are a distinct form of discourse, or a particular mode of discursive production, if you prefer, Barthes&rsquo; &ldquo;Introduction to the Structural Analysis of Narratives&rdquo; captures some of the spirit of one of the pivotal moments in the shaping of narrative as a subject of study and will, for many participants, give some hint of what the formalist-structuralist paradigm looks like. Barthes&rsquo; &ldquo;Introduction to the Structural Analysis of Narratives&rdquo; first appeared in <em>Communications</em> 8 in 1966. (We are reading the translation published in <em>NLH</em> in 1975. Another translation (into English) can be found in <em>Image Music Text</em>, published in 1977.) <em>Communications</em> was a pathbreaking French journal, and this issue featured essays by Greimas, Bremond, Metz, Todorov, and Genette, all of whom were well on their way to becoming some of the more important figures in structuralism and/or narrative studies. They are typically grouped together for their combined debts to a variety of sources which are easily confused for readers otherwise unfamiliar with the broader intellectual history of the twentieth century. Greimas et al. drew upon structural linguistics (as articulated by Saussure and Benveniste), the Prague School (most notably the work of Roman Jakobson), Russian formalism (particularly Propp but also Bakhtin, Medvedev, among others), structural anthropology (as advanced by Claude Levi-Strauss but also found in the work of Mauss).</p>

<p>One of the reasons for this course is the immense amount of discourse focused on <em>stories</em> and <em>storytelling</em> that takes places outside the academy. Some of it, as we have seen, is just that <em>story</em> is the current buzzword, much like <em>paradigm</em> and/or <em>box</em> were in a previous moment. There is, however, a lot of very smart thinking about the shapes of stories taking place. TVTropes is one venue, but writers, readers, and critics of genre fiction also have some very interesting, and often quite compelling things to note about the nature of narrative. One place to start is this analysis of the final battle in the middle movie of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy, aka Helms Deep. The Nerdwriter&rsquo;s analysis includes the notion of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn2-PUq1Z84">beats</a>, something you will find used elsewhere.</p>
