<h2 id="course-projectessay">Course Project/Essay</h2>
<p>For most participants, writing a seminar paper in a course focused on intellectual history is fairly difficult: usually the moment of person syntehsis, that <em>ah-hah!</em> moment, comes in the latter half of the term. That is not terrible timing for a seminar paper, but for attempting anything earlier, it does make things difficult. Based on past experience, I would like to propose that you begin with a <strong>research proposal</strong> with the following contents:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>one-paragraph (200-500 words) statement</strong> of the texts in which you are interested and the theories or models through which you would like to explore them. This is only a preliminary sketch, nothing more. You are putting words down because getting words down is, first, always a good thing, and words beget words, also a good thing. If you&rsquo;d like to break this into more paragraphs, feel free.</li>
<li>a <strong>bibliography</strong>, again preliminary/draft in nature, which is divided into two parts: the texts which you wish to examine and the texts which will serve as your analytical and/or theoretical paradigms and/or models. The more you annotate each of these, the better &ndash; you need to get used to, and good at, explaining yourself to interested but non-expert others. Write like you are talking to a class of undergraduates, interested undergraduates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Single-spaced and citations in whatever formatting your prefer, but used consistently. (For the record, folklore studies uses Chicago B, which makes far more sense than MLA and has not changed in decades.)</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make the proposals due next Wednesday, March 20.</p>
