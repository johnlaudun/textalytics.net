            <p><strong>English 531: Seminar on Folklore in Culture: Studies of Narrative</strong></p>
<h1 id="the-shape-of-stories">The Shape of Stories</h1>
<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Stories feature prominently in our lives and in discourses about our lives. Children ask parents to tell them a story; we swap stories as adults in order to get to know each other; and, increasingly, doctors and lawyers describe the work they do in terms of stories. This seminar is designed to familiarize participants with the wide range of scholarship and science that treats stories. Our goal will be to refine our own working definition of narrative both to understand its nature but also, for those interested in creative projects, to refine our practice. It should be clear from this description that this seminar is open to a wide range of interests: creative, literary, folkloristic, rhetorical, and linguistic.</p>
<h2 id="instructor">Instructor</h2>
<p>Pr. John Laudun. Office: HLG 356, 482-5493, laudun@louisiana.edu. Hours: Tuesdays 9-12 and by appointment.</p>
<h2 id="texts">Texts</h2>
<p>Two texts, one classical and one synthetic, are listed below, but I hope to conduct much of the course through PDFs that are generally available (e.g., PLoS ONE), are available through a university subscription (e.g., JSTOR), or that I make available through the Moodle site. (The usual caveats to using Moodle apply: connections can be flaky; don&rsquo;t wait until the last minute to download an essay.)</p>
<p>Herman, David. 2009. <em>Basic Elements of Narrative</em>. Wiley-Blackwell. (Please do not purchase until we decide to use this text.)</p>
<p>Propp, Vladimir. 1968. <em>Morphology of the Folktale</em>. Tr. Laurence Scott. University of Texas Press.</p>
<p>In addition to (or over and against) scholarly/scientific considerations of narrative, the seminar will develop its own <em>corpus</em> of texts which we will use as a place to apply theories and models, as a vehicle for furthering/deepening our discussion about various theories and models, and as a well from which we can draw our own ideas. For more on the corpus, <a href="#corpus">see below</a>.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>
<h3 id="participation">Participation</h3>
<p>Seminar participants are expected to comport themselves as, well, as if they were in a seminar:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A seminar is, generally, a form of academic instruction, either at an academic institution or offered by a commercial or professional organization. It has the function of bringing together small groups for recurring meetings, focusing each time on some particular subject, in which everyone present is requested to participate actively. This is often accomplished through an ongoing Socratic dialogue with a seminar leader or instructor, or through a more formal presentation of research. The idea behind the seminar system is to familiarize students more extensively with the methodology of their chosen subject and also to allow them to interact with examples of the practical problems that always occur during research work. It is essentially a place where assigned readings are discussed, questions can be raised and debates can be conducted. (Thank you, Wikipedia.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Participation includes a wide variety of forms: active listening, thoughtful speaking, short presentations, involvement in in-class and out-of-class individual and group assignments. Some of these may include, as seems fitting for a seminar led by a folklorist, the occasional exploration of the world beyond campus in the form of observations you make in places like book stores, coffee shops, and other places where people gather to talk or read/write. There is no set list of assignments in this regard: this is something that must arise out of a sense of the seminar as a particular historical group of individuals. (Again, you would expect no less an assertion from a folklorist.)</p>
<p>In addition to the assumed active participation, which includes a number of projects and/or assignments as well as active listening and talking, this seminar also requires the preparation and presentation of a conference paper ( &gt;= 2500 words) and a seminar paper ( &gt;= 7500 words). The idea behind this particular arrangement is that the conference paper will be due before the seminar paper, giving participants an advanced deadline that makes it possible to test the viability of an idea and to have time to expand the paper into something of consequence that we call the seminar paper and we often imagine as leading to an article. That is, both the written assignments in this seminar are designed to match conventional scholarly outputs. (We will have more to discuss &ndash; e.g., how sometimes expanding a conference presentation is harder than shrinking a research paper or what to do when a project implodes at the presentation stage &ndash; during the course of the seminar.) (See the project description below for more information.)</p>
<p>The weighting of grades will be as follows: <em>participation</em> in the seminar, which includes short in-seminar presentations and activities, makes up one half of a participant&rsquo;s evaluation. The <em>conference paper</em> and the <em>seminar paper</em> make up the other half. I hold out any weighting of the two for the following reason: it is entirely possible that the conference paper goes nowhere. If that is the case, first, good. Failure is one way to learn, and it is better to have a project blow up in the smaller form of the conference paper than to fall apart halfway through the seminar paper. Hence, should the conference paper go awry, it should matter less in any final evaluation. The same goes for the seminar paper. This is an educational setting: failure must be an option. (Not trying is not.)</p>
<h3 id="corpus">Corpus</h3>
<p>Because time is not infinite, each of you is constrained by a limit of 10,000 words: this can be one text or several. A further constraint is that we will need to balance our text between those items that are obviously or conventionally narrative and those which test boundaries.</p>
<p>My somewhat informed guess is that many of you already have possible sources, which could range as wildly from the tried and true of <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">Project Gutenberg</a> or <a href="https://archiveofourown.org">An Archive of Our Own</a> to sites and sources which I cannot imagine. Just in case, here are some lists drawn from rambling around the &ldquo;intarwebs&rdquo; that might help you when you get stuck:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Open Culture</em> lists <a href="http://www.openculture.com/free_ebooks">800 Free eBooks for iPad, Kindle &amp; Other Devices</a>. (<em>Open Culture</em> regularly compiles such lists, so it&rsquo;s worth searching for topics or titles that interest you to see what they may have already compiled in a &ldquo;listicle&rdquo; &ndash; <a href="http://katherinemkinnaird.net">Katherine Kinnaird</a> and I got started on our work on TED talks thanks to an <em>OC</em> article about a list of the talks.)</li>
<li><em>NothingintheRuleBook</em> has <a href="https://nothingintherulebook.com/2017/01/10/55-places-you-can-download-tens-of-thousands-books-plays-and-other-literary-texts-completely-legally-for-free/">55 places you can download tens of thousands books, plays and other literary texts completely legally for free</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="project">Project</h3>
<p>For most participants, writing a seminar paper in a course focused on intellectual history is fairly difficult: usually the moment of person syntehsis, that <em>ah-hah!</em> moment, comes in the latter half of the term. That is not terrible timing for a seminar paper, but for attempting anything earlier, it does make things difficult. Based on past experience, I would like to propose that you begin with a <strong>research proposal</strong> with the following contents:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>one-paragraph (200-500 words) statement</strong> of the texts in which you are interested and the theories or models through which you would like to explore them. This is only a preliminary sketch, nothing more. You are putting words down because getting words down is, first, always a good thing, and words beget words, also a good thing. If you&rsquo;d like to break this into more paragraphs, feel free.</li>
<li>a <strong>bibliography</strong>, again preliminary/draft in nature, which is divided into two parts: the texts which you wish to examine and the texts which will serve as your analytical and/or theoretical paradigms and/or models. The more you annotate each of these, the better &ndash; you need to get used to, and good at, explaining yourself to interested but non-expert others. Write like you are talking to a class of undergraduates, interested undergraduates.</li>
</ul>
<p>Single-spaced and citations in whatever formatting your prefer, but used consistently. (For the record, folklore studies uses Chicago B, which makes far more sense than MLA and has not changed in decades.)</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s make the proposals due next Wednesday, March 20.</p>
<h2 id="agenda">Agenda</h2>
<p>Our own interests, expertise, and discoveries will determine more clearly how we will actually spend our time. For those reasons, I prefer to establish an agenda for a course, with the proviso that how much we dwell on a topic or gloss it will effect the timing of matters. While the sequencing of topics should remain fairly stable, the fulfillment of those topics through various readings will be determined by the content of our conversations.</p>
<h3 id="a-bayesian-introduction-to-narrative-studies">A Bayesian Introduction to Narrative Studies</h3>
<p>The first task in any course with some dimension of intellectual history as its focus is to try to understand the overall history of the domain. Narrative, however, is a relatively recent locus for organizing scholarly and scientific investigation. Prior to its development as a subject of study in the twentieth century, narrative was largely viewed through a lens of other objects &ndash; tragic plays, novels, myths. While a seminar of this nature could spend a considerable amount of time in the period prior to the formalist-structuralist articulation of narrative as an object in its own right, we are going to bounce around a bit, hoping, in some shadow of Bayes, to locate ourselves through apparent random pings in the great depths of intellectual history.</p>
<p>We begin with two readings, one a narrative, and one a scholarly examination:</p>
<p>McConnell, Richard. 1924. The Most Dangerous Game. <em>Collier&rsquo;s</em>. [Moodle].</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For those interested in the sheer volume of adaptations of the story, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Most_Dangerous_Game">Wikipedia entry</a> for the short story has a decent, if not complete (because impossible), list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Schiffrin, Deborah. 2009. Crossing Boundaries: The Nexus of Time, Space, Person, and Place in Narrative. <em>Language in Society</em> 38 (4): 421–45. DOI:10.1017/S0047404509990212. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20622659">JSTOR</a>.</p>
<p>Burke, Kenneth. 1973/1941. Literature as Equipment for Living. In <em>The Philosophy of Literary Form</em>, 293-304. University of California Press. [Moodle].</p>
<p>Finally, before we leap into our own exploration of the development of narrative studies, it won&rsquo;t hurt to read some surveys and develop some sense of the larger landscape. For this, there are two encyclopedias, one you know and one you are less likely to know. The first entry for &ldquo;Narratology&rdquo; is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narratology">Wikipedia</a>, and the second in the <a href="https://www.lhn.uni-hamburg.de/article/narratology">Living Handbook of Narratology</a>. The former is short; the latter long.</p>
<h3 id="unitizing-narrative-motifs-functions">Unitizing Narrative: Motifs &amp; Functions</h3>
<p>Before we examine Propp&rsquo;s work, it&rsquo;s important to understand the larger dialogue in which he is engaging. Specifically, early in <em>Morphology</em>, Propp notes that &ldquo;the study of the tale has been pursued for the most part only genetically, and, to a great extent, without attempts at preliminary, systematic description&rdquo; (5). <em>Genetic</em> references the great philological collection projects of the nineteenth century that were, for the most part, focused on origins and originals. In the twentieth century, that focus would become what is now known as the historic-geographic method, and its most noted accomplishment are the great indices of folklore studies: the tale-type index and the motif index. The best way to understand them is to use them. (More on genetic matters below.)</p>
<h4 id="the-indices">The Indices</h4>
<p>The Aarne-Thompson-Uther classification system is available on-line as part of the <a href="http://www.mftd.org/index.php">Multilingual Folk Tale Database</a>. A concise explanation of the ATU system is offered <a href="http://oaks.nvg.org/folktale-types.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>In preparation for actually using the two iconic folklore indices, I would suggest the following reading:</p>
<p>Again, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_(folkloristics)">Wikipedia</a> is not a terrible place to start. And there are two other online sources that are worth your time:</p>
<p>Richard Kuehnel and Rado Lencek. <a href="https://www.aktuellum.com/mobile/slavic/folklore-motif/">What is a Folklore Motif?</a></p>
<p><a href="https://sites.ualberta.ca/~urban/Projects/English/Content/Motif_Help.htm">How to use Thompson&rsquo;s Folklore Motif Index</a></p>
<p>Two of the Grimms tales are available entirely in plain text for your use: <a href="../texts/grimms_91/">Grimms 91</a>, sometimes titled as &ldquo;The Gnome&rdquo; and sometimes as &ldquo;The Elves&rdquo; and <a href="../texts/hicks_2/">&ldquo;Jack and the Fire Dragon&rdquo;</a> as told by Ray Hicks.</p>
<p>This seminar would be remiss if you did not read about the idea of <em>motif</em> from the compiler himself, Stith Thompson. I have also included Angela Maniak&rsquo;s short introduction to the role of the role of indexes, or indices, and bibliographies in classical forms of scholarship for those less acquainted with them. Finally, the long essay by Dan Ben-Amos is for those committed to understanding the nuances of folklore studies&rsquo; intellectual history.</p>

<p>A slightly different approach to unitizing narrative, but proceeding along the same lines as the historic-geographic school, can be found in the work of <a href="https://www.dur.ac.uk/anthropology/staff/academic/?id=5388">Jamshid J. Tehrani</a>, who has parsed narratives into <em>traits</em> that look a lot like motifs and then attempted phylogenetic analysis on variations on a text to see which are more closely related. His analysis takes place against a backdrop of history and cultural geography.</p>

<h4 id="propp">Propp</h4>
<p>The intertwined, and yet not intersecting, history of motifs and functions is not one on which I can comment. Structuralists outside folklore studies never took up the motif, and folkorists, while fascinated with function, never developed the idea much. Propp&rsquo;s Morphology, however, has enjoyed a renaissance of late. (It is perhaps because the kinds of data and analysis needed for structuralism has finally come to be &ndash; see Miranda for more.)</p>
<p>Propp, Vladimir. 1968. <em>Morphology of the Folktale</em>. Tr. Laurence Scott. University of Texas Press. [Moodle].</p>
<p>And here are some <a href="../texts/legends/">Louisiana legends</a> to consider. (For a text analytical perspective, the corpus is also on <a href="https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=542be74058f3710c6026a1e81a763502&amp;panels=collocatesgraph,reader,trends,summary,bubblelines">Voyant-Tools</a>)</p>
<p>Contemporary considerations of Propp include:</p>

<p>The motif is one of those things that seems old-fashioned and yet has renewed interest in the era of data science (for a variety of reasons). In computer science, <a href="https://users.cs.fiu.edu/~markaf/">Mark Finlayson</a> has done some remarkable work &ndash; see his profile page for a complete bibliography &ndash; but those works directly related to Propp are below. (Please note that computer science, like the sciences in general, is really good about making their work easily accessible: the obsession with tying any work up with protections is the best path to obscurity, literal and figurative.)

<p>For those familiar with Claude Lévi-Strauss, it might surprise you to learn that while his early work on kinship had established him in the academy, his rise to star status actually emerged from his memoir, <em>Tristes Tropiques</em>, published in the same year, 1955, as &ldquo;The Structural Study of Myth&rdquo; (below). The essay was one stepping stone &ndash; others are collected in <em>Structural Anthropology</em> &ndash; to his longer treatment of myth in <em>La Pensée Sauvage</em> (1964, translated as <em>The Savage Mind</em> in English, which, as is usual for translations of Levi-Strauss, and later Derrida, misses the linguistic play often at the heart of his writing).</p>

<p>While we will return to the idea that narratives are a distinct form of discourse, or a particular mode of discursive production, if you prefer, Barthes&rsquo; &ldquo;Introduction to the Structural Analysis of Narratives&rdquo; captures some of the spirit of one of the pivotal moments in the shaping of narrative as a subject of study and will, for many participants, give some hint of what the formalist-structuralist paradigm looks like. Barthes&rsquo; &ldquo;Introduction to the Structural Analysis of Narratives&rdquo; first appeared in <em>Communications</em> 8 in 1966. (We are reading the translation published in <em>NLH</em> in 1975. Another translation (into English) can be found in <em>Image Music Text</em>, published in 1977.) <em>Communications</em> was a pathbreaking French journal, and this issue featured essays by Greimas, Bremond, Metz, Todorov, and Genette, all of whom were well on their way to becoming some of the more important figures in structuralism and/or narrative studies. They are typically grouped together for their combined debts to a variety of sources which are easily confused for readers otherwise unfamiliar with the broader intellectual history of the twentieth century. Greimas et al. drew upon structural linguistics (as articulated by Saussure and Benveniste), the Prague School (most notably the work of Roman Jakobson), Russian formalism (particularly Propp but also Bakhtin, Medvedev, among others), structural anthropology (as advanced by Claude Levi-Strauss but also found in the work of Mauss).</p>

<p>One of the reasons for this course is the immense amount of discourse focused on <em>stories</em> and <em>storytelling</em> that takes places outside the academy. Some of it, as we have seen, is just that <em>story</em> is the current buzzword, much like <em>paradigm</em> and/or <em>box</em> were in a previous moment. There is, however, a lot of very smart thinking about the shapes of stories taking place. TVTropes is one venue, but writers, readers, and critics of genre fiction also have some very interesting, and often quite compelling things to note about the nature of narrative. One place to start is this analysis of the final battle in the middle movie of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy, aka Helms Deep. The Nerdwriter&rsquo;s analysis includes the notion of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn2-PUq1Z84">beats</a>, something you will find used elsewhere.</p>

<p>Please note that the hyperlinks for JSTOR and Project Muse take you directly to the journal&rsquo;s main page and not the home page of those two services.</p>
<p>The <em>Journal of Narrative Theory</em> appears to be the oldest journal focused specifically on narrative. Founded in 1971 as the <em>Journal of Narrative Technique</em>, JNT &ldquo;has provided a forum for the theoretical exploration of narrative in all its forms. Building on this foundation, JNT publishes essays addressing the epistemological, global, historical, formal, and political dimensions of narrative from a variety of methodological and theoretical perspectives.&rdquo; JNT is available on-line through Project Muse.</p>
<p><em>Narrative</em> is &ldquo;the official journal of the International Society for the Study of Narrative. Narrative&rsquo;s broad range of scholarship includes the English, American, and European novel, nonfiction narrative, film, and narrative as used in performance art.&rdquo; The Society&rsquo;s website is: <a href="http://narrative.georgetown.edu/">http://narrative.georgetown.edu/</a>. Online access to articles is available through Project Muse (2002-present). Issues prior to 2002 are available through JSTOR.</p>
<p><em>Storyworlds</em> is a new, interdisciplinary journal of narrative theory. It features research on storytelling practices across a variety of media, including face-to-face interaction, literary writing, film and television, virtual environments, historiography, journalism, and graphic narratives, studied from perspectives developed in such fields as narratology, discourse analysis, jurisprudence, philosophy, cognitive and social psychology, Artificial Intelligence, medicine, and the study of organizations.&rdquo; Current journal contents and contact information are available at <a href="http://storyworlds.osu.edu">http://storyworlds.osu.edu</a>. The journal is available on-line on Project Muse.</p>
<p>In addition to these journals focused narrowly on narrative, there are journals that address narrative specifically but from a particular perspective. Obviously most, if not all, of the journals with which you are familiar in the fields of composition, folklore, or literary studies will include narrative as part of their purview, but you may also want to take a look at a few other journals that you, perhaps, would not normally encounter, such as <em>Discourse Processes</em> or <em>Genre</em>.</p>
