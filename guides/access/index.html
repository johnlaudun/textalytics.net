            <h3 id="accessing-materials">Accessing Materials</h3>
<p>Please note that, in most cases, the direct link to the original source of an article or other kind of resource is posted in course materials: it&rsquo;s important that you understand for yourself from whence information comes and it is expected that you will take some time to chart the network of sources for yourself. In some cases, the linked material will be openly available and accessible to you. In other cases, the link will be to one of a number of content aggregators for which the university has subscribed to make access available to you. (Please remember that servers cost money, both in terms of hardware and in terms of the people who maintain the hardware, and the software. The university&rsquo;s subscription helps to underwrite those costs and makes the business of science and scholarship possible.)</p>
<p>Quite often, a link will take you to JSTOR, if only because that is where a number of folklore studies journals are archived. The links look like this if you hover over them or if you right- or control-click to copy them:</p>
<pre><code>http://jstor.org/stable/538099
</code></pre>
<p>If you are on campus, you will be taken directly to the JSTOR, or Project Muse, page. If you are off campus, you will need to do a bit of legwork: off-campus users will need to copy the DOI portion of the JSTOR URL into the proxy address, once they have logged into the proxy service through the Library web page. (Easiest way is to click on the link to JSTOR.) In most instances it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>http://ezproxyprod.ucs.louisiana.edu:2079/stable/10.2307/538099
</code></pre>
<p>Do you see where the identifying number of the article is located? There are two sets of numbers at the end of the URL:</p>
<pre><code>10.2307/538099
</code></pre>
<p>Together they make up the DOI for this article. The alternative, of course, is that you simply use the citation information to search for the article yourself, which is never a bad idea.</p>
